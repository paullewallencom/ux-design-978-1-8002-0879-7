00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
Welcome to course about User Experience Design Process and 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.020
in this course, I am going to simplify this

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.080
process for you

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.960
Now I have seen tons of

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.960
different User Experience Design methods

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.960
User Experience Design

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.900
terminologies that are circulating

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.900
online and when a newbie like

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.900
me or like you, when they start

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.500
learning something they get confused that

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.660
how I am going to start

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.660
my User Experience Design Process

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.980
Now I want to build an App or an eCommerce Store

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.260
where should I start my User Research

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.120
what is the information I am going to get

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.120
from it. How I am going to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.460
form that Information into Personas

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.460
into User stories and

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.600
into different Affinity Diagrams & all that stuff

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.100
So in this course I am going to go from

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.340
Step by Step from Step 01

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.620
which is User Investigation and Research

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.940
and then we are going to go to step 02

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.160
Design and we are going to make sense

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.560
of that User Data we have collected

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.840
and we are going to form in the end

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.760
the end result with be our

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Wire-frames which we will deliver to our

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.560
designers and development team

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.240
Now we are going to also make different

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.920
Business decisions that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.040
which feature we should build or which

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.620
feature we should not build so these are all the things

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.360
we are going to cover in this course

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.360
if you are Beginner, this is a 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.360
project based course so don't

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.360
need to worry about it. We are going to build an

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.700
eCommerce store from User Research

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.060
to actually creating wire-frames for this

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.240
eCommerce store. You are going to really love it

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.240
If you have any questions regarding this

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240
course, you can always ask me

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240
You can post your comments or

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.620
or suggestion or if you want

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.620
something more from me. You can always ask

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.820
me, I can add into that course

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.980
So I hope you will learn a lot

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.980
along with me in this course

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980
so let's start designing

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.980
some awesome User Experiences
