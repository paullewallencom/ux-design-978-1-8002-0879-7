Now the quickest way to build any idea or generate any idea is sketching.

00:09.930 --> 00:15.380
You always need a pen and a pencil or a pencil with a paper.

00:15.390 --> 00:23.700
And that is the most easiest and most cost effective and time less time taking procedure of generating

00:23.700 --> 00:24.650
ideas.

00:24.660 --> 00:32.880
So once we have decided that these are the things our customers or our users or our personas need we

00:32.880 --> 00:36.210
already have identified what are their needs and things like that.

00:36.210 --> 00:40.380
We already have defined the categories of their information architecture.

00:40.380 --> 00:44.230
We are going to quickly sketch out the layout of the information.

00:44.340 --> 00:46.100
So what will be present at that door.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.620
What will be present in the middle of the page.

00:48.620 --> 00:50.340
What will be at the bottom of the page.

00:50.520 --> 00:56.190
And we are going to prioritize information hierarchy on the page so sketching is actually going to be

00:56.190 --> 01:02.790
an exercise you can include your developers you can include your stakeholders your CEOs whatever you

01:02.790 --> 01:07.530
can all gather them around and give them papers to sketch.

01:07.580 --> 01:13.000
Now here are the things you are going to keep in mind while you are doing this ideation exercise.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.690
It is a collaborative effort.

01:14.840 --> 01:21.640
You are going to include two or three or four people around you from your team to do the ideation.

01:21.740 --> 01:29.980
So try to give them a limit that we have 30 minutes to do six sketches whatever comes up to your mind

01:29.990 --> 01:33.930
just tried using whatever information we are going to present.

01:34.010 --> 01:41.900
So they all have the idea of the personas and the things they must have gone through all the things

01:41.900 --> 01:44.390
so they can generate different ideas.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.580
So the sketches should be rough.

01:46.580 --> 01:53.610
You are not going to you know make them pixel perfect or draw them using a ruler or a pencil.

01:53.660 --> 02:01.730
So just at least create two to three ideas minimum so give everyone a task that you should create two

02:01.730 --> 02:03.120
to three ideas.

02:03.170 --> 02:09.170
You can also do this exercise in a user interview or a stake holder interview so to get the idea of

02:09.170 --> 02:14.930
the user what is in their head or to get the idea of the stakeholders works in their head.

02:14.930 --> 02:20.190
You can also use this at the design stage where you are going to start your design.

02:20.210 --> 02:26.420
So this is just a technique you can use it anywhere in your design and user experience design process.

02:26.420 --> 02:32.360
Here are a few example of the sketches your stakeholders might have said something like this like you

02:32.360 --> 02:38.930
can see over here which only you can understand when they are trying they might explain it to you.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.600
You can tell them what is this.

02:40.610 --> 02:43.010
Explain it to me to get more ideas.

02:43.010 --> 02:48.080
You can also highlight different sections and label them that this is going to do this.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.990
This is going to do this but it should be readable at least and understandable by anyone who is looking

02:53.990 --> 02:54.410
at them.

02:54.770 --> 03:04.640
So try to create a sketch which is easily recognizable easily tell the story what it is what is happening

03:04.640 --> 03:07.960
in this sketch and here are a few more you can see.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.850
This is a bit more detailed.

03:09.870 --> 03:13.260
It shows videos music and things like that.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.790
Then we have this one.

03:14.810 --> 03:16.190
So these are different examples.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.510
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.180
Let's move on to the next lesson.
