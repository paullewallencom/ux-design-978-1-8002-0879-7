00:04.790 --> 00:10.760
In this video I'm going to show you and introduce you to flawed user flaws and how actually you can

00:10.760 --> 00:16.400
create this flawed diagram and what actually all these symbols mean what does what does this rectangle

00:16.400 --> 00:16.700
mean.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.500
What does this all mean.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.540
What does this diamond actually means.

00:20.540 --> 00:22.910
And also this parallelogram.

00:22.970 --> 00:29.000
So we are going to cover just these four basic shapes there are a lot of other shapes but I think we

00:29.000 --> 00:34.880
don't need most of them right now I am using floor map which is an awesome online app to create user

00:34.880 --> 00:43.400
flows I am on right now our free plan so you can go ahead sign up and use that and create start creating

00:43.400 --> 00:48.960
user flows and site maps anyhow so right now we are going to start with this user flow.

00:48.980 --> 00:57.140
No this user flow is actually about a user downloading the invasion app which is a bird typing app and

00:57.140 --> 00:59.140
actually commenting on the prototype.

00:59.240 --> 01:05.030
So all the steps involved from start to finish till the time he commence.

01:05.030 --> 01:12.500
We are going to show them in a flow that is user is going to flow from here to here to to new screen

01:12.500 --> 01:18.350
to new process to or new action so you can see the first step is actually a rectangle rectangle means

01:18.850 --> 01:22.140
a process or activity so download and vision app in app store.

01:22.140 --> 01:26.120
So this is a process I am doing I am doing an activity that I am going to launch it.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.520
This is another activity.

01:27.620 --> 01:35.690
Now you can see sign is in is actually in an oval now why it isn't in an all because all means that

01:35.720 --> 01:41.300
it is going to be the starting point of that process.

01:41.300 --> 01:48.320
So you can see these are actually pretty preliminary actions we had to download in vision app do you

01:48.320 --> 01:51.380
know do that and do comment on the prototype.

01:51.380 --> 01:55.880
So this is actually the starting park sign in and you can see if we.

01:56.080 --> 02:02.720
I'm pressing actually space bot and dragging it up and here we have already have an account.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.590
So this is a decision.

02:04.730 --> 02:05.950
So it has two parts.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.100
If you have the account you are going to go to one path.

02:09.110 --> 02:12.690
If you don't have the account you are going to go to another part.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.520
So these are two parts.

02:14.540 --> 02:17.480
So once we have a decision to make.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.170
We are going to use this diamond.

02:20.180 --> 02:21.440
So already have an account.

02:21.440 --> 02:25.640
Question mark or if yes we are going to enter log in and password.

02:25.910 --> 02:27.720
So this is an input.

02:27.770 --> 02:33.010
We are inputting into the system our log in and password fields.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.130
We are putting data.

02:34.490 --> 02:43.160
So this parallelogram is actually mean means that we are giving some input so whenever you try to give

02:43.160 --> 02:50.450
some input to your system in any format a filling a form or filling sign a form or things like that

02:50.450 --> 02:55.040
you are going to enter and you are going to use this parallelogram.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.270
If you don't have an account you have to go through the sign up process.

02:59.420 --> 03:05.080
It is a process so that is why it is actually showing into a rectangle.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.970
Let's go down.

03:07.140 --> 03:07.360
Okay.

03:07.370 --> 03:14.040
So after logging and sign up we are going to go to the home screen and then we are moving to the next

03:14.100 --> 03:21.740
application navigation then we want to see and comment on the prototype then we have open prototype

03:21.750 --> 03:27.540
tabs so these are all the processes and the user is doing so he is right now open the prototype tab

03:28.440 --> 03:36.500
then we have an active prototype opens up prototype for active product select the layout opens the layout

03:36.510 --> 03:41.360
holds dab dab so you can see these are all different processes.

03:41.370 --> 03:48.020
There is no decision it is a straightforward one step next step and next step then we have you can see

03:48.020 --> 03:54.520
you here wants to leave a comment so whether he wants to press cancel.

03:54.920 --> 04:02.300
So there are two parts whether he can leave a comment or he can he can press cancel and go back to this

04:02.300 --> 04:04.370
layout so you can see or hear.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.910
Here we have two parts.

04:05.930 --> 04:11.510
One is this cancel and it goes back to open the layout and if we press yes and click on the comment

04:11.510 --> 04:16.840
board it is going to go to the command more so this is actually going to end under process line over

04:16.850 --> 04:24.050
here and you can see click command mode select command area right are command so whenever you are typing

04:24.050 --> 04:25.690
something you are inputting.

04:25.730 --> 04:29.930
So again we are using a parallelogram and press to publish.

04:29.930 --> 04:36.730
So this is actually the end whenever a process or every anything completes or ends.

04:37.010 --> 04:42.700
You are going to use a circle okay press to publish you can see it is a green circle.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.240
Now here it ends.

04:44.450 --> 04:53.990
So that is all about creating the user flow diagram in this flow map you can use any other Graphic Tool

04:53.990 --> 04:57.820
too but I think using this online is very easy.

04:57.860 --> 05:07.830
They have all the shapes and everything already built in so if I go to my account let me go to my account

05:10.070 --> 05:11.290
I have projects.

05:11.300 --> 05:19.430
This one is from Thailand and if I go ahead you can see here is the site map I have created.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.820
Here is the user flow diagram.

05:22.510 --> 05:29.090
Now if I want to add something over here I am going to click over here in this empty area and I am going

05:29.090 --> 05:41.420
to use Sokolow ahead because it has ended so I am going to say something like uh successful

05:44.490 --> 05:48.580
onboarding let's make it a little bigger

05:52.540 --> 05:53.260
like this

05:57.700 --> 05:58.640
make this okay.

05:59.680 --> 06:06.150
Now we are going to connect it with like this one and let's turn this to green

06:09.920 --> 06:18.350
so we have our successful onboarding so you can see over here you can also do something over here like

06:19.760 --> 06:30.230
this I'm going to press over here start so before that if we want to have a few more screens over here

06:30.290 --> 06:41.570
I can link it over here like this if I want to have something like a process which is download app download

06:41.570 --> 06:52.500
app from App Store and then we are going to have another one which is uh over here.

06:55.110 --> 07:02.210
Launch app so far app or something like that.

07:02.230 --> 07:02.460
Okay.

07:02.470 --> 07:07.850
So we are going to connect them like this like this.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.680
So you can see it is pretty easy.

07:09.840 --> 07:14.610
We have these two processes then we have the start once it has been launched.

07:14.610 --> 07:19.380
It is going to show us a welcome screen have an account.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.340
No.

07:20.490 --> 07:24.890
Then we are going to have this Create Account or sign up a sign up.

07:25.080 --> 07:29.300
And if we have this then we are going to go to log in.

07:29.340 --> 07:31.190
You can also use an input all here.

07:31.200 --> 07:37.440
But for simplicity I am I have skipped that and if you want to use it you can use it.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.910
Let's drag it a bit at the bottom.

07:40.930 --> 07:49.900
I'm going to expand it a bit because it is a not showing okay.

07:49.940 --> 08:01.970
So now it is showing let's move this subject over here with your hand like this.

08:02.520 --> 08:02.810
OK.

08:02.810 --> 08:07.420
So here we have our onboarding user flow diagram.

08:07.410 --> 08:13.190
And if you want to export it you can go to this add over here you can share it with from over here and

08:13.190 --> 08:14.940
you can export it from here.

08:14.960 --> 08:22.420
So if you click on export you can see we have few options that export as SPG format export as a BMG

08:22.430 --> 08:28.280
format transparent background if I want a transparent background I can have a transparent background

08:28.280 --> 08:30.880
project title document creation date.

08:30.890 --> 08:32.870
You can hide it if you want to show it.

08:33.080 --> 08:41.090
Then we have original size and I think we can also have custom size but it is actually maybe for the

08:41.150 --> 08:50.180
BMG because SVOD scalable vector graphic we don't need a size for BMG we might want to use some custom

08:50.180 --> 08:54.140
size over here for example 3000 by 100 1012.

08:54.350 --> 09:02.790
And I'm going to export it as being G and if you want to export it as SPG that's another thing.

09:02.820 --> 09:10.500
You can also export is it as a dark document X which is a new feature I think they have just added you

09:10.500 --> 09:12.890
can also export it as a BD F.

09:13.050 --> 09:16.170
So these are all different exporting options.

09:16.230 --> 09:22.620
You can click on generate preview and it is going to load the preview project name.

09:22.620 --> 09:26.990
So that is this is it's site map

09:30.450 --> 09:30.710
OK.

09:30.720 --> 09:37.620
So that is all if you have any questions or any comments or anything you want to learn about this app

09:37.620 --> 09:44.940
flow map are about user flaws or site maps let me know if you have any questions to ask me.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.030
Let's move on to the next lesson and the next video.
