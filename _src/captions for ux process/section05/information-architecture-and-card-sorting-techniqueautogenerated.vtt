00:04.860 --> 00:10.170
Now we are going to talk about information architecture and how I actually do research.

00:10.210 --> 00:15.330
And you can say and hostile Information Architecture for my frock land.

00:15.340 --> 00:23.470
I'm going to show you some clips of my users how actually I you know interviewed them and used different

00:23.470 --> 00:30.910
techniques to allocate good information about our information architecture and how actually our users

00:30.910 --> 00:36.640
consume and search on frog land or any e-commerce store.

00:36.640 --> 00:43.120
Now the information architecture is all about the information in the form of videos in the form of tax

00:43.150 --> 00:50.710
in the form of headings in the form of images or in the form of products listed listings different listings

00:50.950 --> 00:54.040
or in the form of different contexts you see on your mobile.

00:54.160 --> 01:00.820
And we are going to present that information in the most understandable way which our users can easily

01:01.330 --> 01:02.190
understand.

01:02.230 --> 01:09.950
So the things that questions like how users will find this information how users will reach this information.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.990
Which part they are going to select to reached.

01:13.130 --> 01:19.210
And this information and how they are going to understand this information structure.

01:19.210 --> 01:26.740
So for example if you look at any products face where we have details of any product or any sweeter

01:26.740 --> 01:32.830
or Claude or shirt you can see there are chunks of different informations like color.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.390
We have material.

01:35.410 --> 01:41.650
What is it is made of different sizes available different reviews from our customers.

01:41.650 --> 01:47.570
So these are all part of the information blocks about that product.

01:47.590 --> 01:54.670
Also we are going to look at navigation for example our main navigation of our website different categories

01:54.700 --> 01:57.250
of our goods breadcrumbs.

01:57.250 --> 02:04.720
You can see breadcrumbs are actually the part of your product page is showing that this product is in

02:04.720 --> 02:08.670
this category and this category resides within this category.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.890
Things like that then we have product tags.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.910
So what is the product act.

02:13.930 --> 02:14.410
Tag.

02:14.410 --> 02:20.500
So there are different tags you might have used hashtags on Twitter or Facebook that are also part of

02:20.920 --> 02:27.790
information architecture and how you actually find information of what is included in Information Architecture

02:28.450 --> 02:34.540
everything that you are going to label or you are going to sort of search or find or organize information

02:34.540 --> 02:42.310
in a way that it is easier for the user to consume is actually all in inside the border of information

02:42.310 --> 02:43.390
architecture.

02:43.390 --> 02:50.020
Now in my fraudulent e-commerce Web site you can see we have some features like a sorting with price

02:50.020 --> 02:58.810
low to high alphabetical date or based on tags categories like maybe we are going to sort our information

02:59.170 --> 03:03.120
using fabric type like cotton linen and things like that.

03:03.130 --> 03:06.250
Then we also can sort with based on colors.

03:06.250 --> 03:12.160
So if I just click on blue or red or things like that it is going to list all the different items based

03:12.160 --> 03:13.570
on these.

03:13.570 --> 03:18.590
So product view you can also use the same thing with product tags.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.400
For example Red Cinderella.

03:20.710 --> 03:27.340
So it is also going to help find that dress and it is also going to help build our database of information

03:27.340 --> 03:31.510
about that particular thing that user actually needs.

03:31.510 --> 03:36.430
Now we are going to talk about a technique that we can use to build information architecture or get

03:36.430 --> 03:39.820
some more information about the architecture of your website.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.730
Major categories.

03:42.040 --> 03:49.450
So it is called card sorting and card sorting is a simple technique where you are going to categorize

03:49.450 --> 03:54.890
the information in by asking your users to sort out the different categories.

03:54.910 --> 04:01.510
So in my Frankland example I let my users to you know decide the categories off my top navigation bar

04:01.550 --> 04:07.150
and what they are looking at in that top navigation but in the end of the lesson I am going to share

04:07.150 --> 04:14.380
with you the screenshots or the images I have taken while my user were you know filling out different

04:14.680 --> 04:18.090
card sorting things and different information architecture questions.

04:18.130 --> 04:21.550
Before that we need to learn more about cards sorting.

04:21.550 --> 04:23.470
Now there are different types of card sorting.

04:23.470 --> 04:27.720
There is open cards so there is closed cards or technique.

04:27.730 --> 04:35.650
Then we have hybrid cards or no open cards or is that your you let your users to you know make sense

04:35.650 --> 04:36.220
of the data.

04:36.220 --> 04:43.600
So if you show them a few frocks that these are different kind of frocks What will you call this category

04:43.600 --> 04:44.530
of rocks.

04:44.530 --> 04:50.100
So if they write like fancy dress or maybe Barbie dress you make that category.

04:50.140 --> 04:56.470
So this is your users are deciding everything they are sorting their cards into categories and labeling

04:56.470 --> 04:57.080
them.

04:57.190 --> 05:03.980
So you give them the opportunity to label them then we have closed card sorting you are going to give

05:04.010 --> 05:09.920
and write all the labels on the cards and as your participants all your users they are going to just

05:09.920 --> 05:14.660
sort them into the order they think that this should be filing in this category.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.880
This should be falling in this category.

05:16.880 --> 05:24.830
So this is you know the user has less control over it than we have hybrid cards sword sort which I actually

05:24.830 --> 05:25.720
used.

05:25.730 --> 05:31.580
I will get I gave participant few cards and I also let them write different categories of their own

05:31.690 --> 05:39.720
and twice maybe they have something else in their mind now here are a few images when I was doing some

05:39.720 --> 05:42.570
information architecture research using my user.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.100
It is not a very you can see unique study.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.470
It is very simple.

05:46.470 --> 05:51.000
I just gave them such bar and assured them few for images of frocks.

05:51.150 --> 05:57.840
And I tell them that what you are going to write in this search bar to search for this kind of dress.

05:57.900 --> 06:03.900
So I want you to learn what is the category of what is a term they are going to use to find this information

06:03.900 --> 06:10.320
which is very essential in information architecture how they reach that information.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.210
This is the question I showed you in the start.

06:14.280 --> 06:20.760
Here you can see I gave them a few closed cards sorting and I have already given them few for four or

06:20.760 --> 06:25.170
five options and I let them choose which one makes more sense to them.

06:25.200 --> 06:30.990
So instead of party dresses they selected fancy frocks and you can see they are taking this that this

06:30.990 --> 06:37.980
makes sense I am going to look for fancy frocks party dress doesn't make much sense to them casual dress

06:37.980 --> 06:44.940
and princess dress was also great but actually instead of searching for princess dresses you can see

06:44.940 --> 06:48.750
on the left they used Barbie dresses in the search bar.

06:48.750 --> 06:54.400
So these are actually you can see the categories our user actually started.

06:54.420 --> 06:58.710
You can also see in at the end I have written over here some other collections.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.770
OK so this is actually they were looking for.

07:01.770 --> 07:06.930
They were looking for rental collections and summer collections based on the season which I never thought

07:06.930 --> 07:15.120
that it would be you know possible I have never seen any e-commerce website that has a seasonal collections

07:15.450 --> 07:20.820
or have some collection at the top that season for example summer collection or winter collection or

07:20.820 --> 07:22.700
autumn collection things like that.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.440
So this is this was a new idea to me.

07:25.650 --> 07:28.970
You can see here another category she wrote.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.200
She is writing right now.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.580
Ball ball type dresses which will hire.

07:32.580 --> 07:38.340
You can see here fancy dresses there are actually fancy dresses but they had some balls on the top of

07:38.940 --> 07:46.770
the neck near the neck and actually and this can be our you can say hashtag because user tried to search

07:46.770 --> 07:51.480
for bored bored type dresses or bored dresses or dresses with bows.

07:51.510 --> 07:56.970
So we can give them suggestions while they were trying to tie pants that I bought.

07:56.970 --> 08:03.870
We can give them suggestions and a pop up and they can easily search for that so we can use a suggestion

08:03.870 --> 08:10.110
based feature for searching which makes it easier for the users and we can use tags to tags different

08:10.170 --> 08:13.380
elements of our our dresses.

08:13.770 --> 08:20.990
So this is actually how we are going to do card sorting and and get some information architecture.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.250
We can I also actually give them some images and you know for getting the product details which was

08:29.310 --> 08:30.440
another thing.

08:30.750 --> 08:36.480
So information on a product detail page I collected on another site which I think I don't have an image

08:36.480 --> 08:40.740
right now but that is all about car sorting and information architecture.

08:40.740 --> 08:47.040
You can collect information like that and don't keep trying to keep the record of that.

08:47.040 --> 08:53.250
You must have something like this so you can refer back to that and build and use information architecture

08:53.250 --> 08:54.120
upon that.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.700
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

08:55.710 --> 08:59.430
If you have any questions to ask me let's move on to the next lesson.
