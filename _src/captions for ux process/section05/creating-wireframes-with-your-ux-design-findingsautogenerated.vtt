WEBVTT

00:04.460 --> 00:10.850
Now we have all the requirements of a user but actually a user needs on a page what information they

00:10.850 --> 00:13.860
are going to use to make a buying decision.

00:14.210 --> 00:19.610
And then we have all the user flows and how user is going to move from one page to another one.

00:19.610 --> 00:26.270
We have information architecture built on the user research where we found that user is going to use

00:26.280 --> 00:33.950
search box or sometimes looking for main categories ie summer collection and things like that and they

00:33.950 --> 00:38.900
are looking for deals page on the main page and things like that so we have collected all the essential

00:38.900 --> 00:44.680
information to go through and create a wireframe of our concept.

00:44.690 --> 00:49.550
So this is actually our design phase and we are actually using all the information we have gathered

00:49.550 --> 00:56.510
in the previous last lessons we have covered and it is going to be a blueprint of what actually the

00:56.510 --> 00:59.450
content must be present on a page.

00:59.450 --> 01:04.670
So we are going to add more structure and details but the colors we are not going to use colors and

01:04.670 --> 01:12.200
typefaces because it is more of a subjective issue we are more concerned about what the information

01:12.290 --> 01:19.920
must be present on a page for our user to make the decisions and secondly we are going to test it with

01:19.920 --> 01:24.940
the user that this information is essential or is it adequate for the user.

01:24.950 --> 01:34.370
And also we will show it to our stakeholders our CEO which is in case in me to see whether this is appropriate

01:34.760 --> 01:36.510
or not.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.980
So this is actually these.

01:38.990 --> 01:45.260
This is vital frame stage and via frames is let me tell you one most important thing that vial frames

01:45.320 --> 01:53.180
are the bread and butter or you can say the last final stage of a user experience designer if you are

01:53.180 --> 01:55.690
a user expand research or whatever you are.

01:55.730 --> 02:00.650
These are the things that will be the final deliverables to your design and development team.

02:00.710 --> 02:02.330
So this is very important.

02:02.390 --> 02:07.820
You can create them with any tool you have you can create them on panel paper you can create them digitally

02:07.820 --> 02:15.470
you can create them using balsamic mockups or you can use Adobe actually Photoshop or sketch software

02:15.920 --> 02:17.780
or whatever tool you have.

02:17.900 --> 02:21.930
Now let's talk about the level of detail is when you are designing something.

02:21.930 --> 02:28.160
So most of the times when you read any requirements for a job or things like that there is there are

02:28.160 --> 02:36.290
terms like lo fi medium FI or high fire low fire these I have seen a lot of times low fertility means

02:36.290 --> 02:44.690
low details they are like close to sketched things so we divide frames are almost at this stage medium

02:44.690 --> 02:52.070
fidelity might have some colors it is rough you can say interface belt portrait prototype maybe a rough

02:52.070 --> 02:59.000
prototype might have a medium fidelity and the high fidelity is actually our mock up which we are going

02:59.000 --> 03:05.210
to create and sketch or Adobe Photoshop it will be actually which will be the final user interface for

03:05.210 --> 03:06.890
our website.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.820
So this is actually the difference.

03:08.840 --> 03:14.780
You should know this difference because sometimes it is inside a job application and you should be able

03:14.780 --> 03:16.280
to understand it.

03:16.340 --> 03:22.940
Now let's see the wireframe I created for the main page and I am going to show you why I actually made

03:22.970 --> 03:24.350
all these decisions.

03:24.350 --> 03:27.540
So let's see and and go and see that.

03:27.800 --> 03:33.390
Now this is balsamic mockup software which I use to create quick mock ups you can use it will be extra

03:33.440 --> 03:37.760
Photoshop or anyone anything you have are a piece of paper if you want.

03:38.270 --> 03:44.480
Okay so here's a wireframe I really recommend that you create a wireframe using a digital app because

03:44.480 --> 03:51.230
it is more precise and you can print it and show it to others so you can see here we have the logo.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.300
This is our logo for our client.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.230
This is just the meeting we are not more.

03:56.370 --> 04:02.480
And we are not focusing on the visuals or visual design we are focusing on the message and what must

04:02.480 --> 04:09.980
be present are for the user to make the buying decision and what to make the users Apogee is easy and

04:09.980 --> 04:13.950
user friendly and improve the user experience of this e-commerce store.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.270
So let's let's zoom in a bit.

04:17.270 --> 04:20.590
Let's see if we have a full page view.

04:21.930 --> 04:30.770
There might be something over here to show at control f Okay so this is good.

04:31.270 --> 04:31.870
OK.

04:32.090 --> 04:39.290
So now you can see here we have on the left floor plan an authentic place to buy imported dresses just

04:39.290 --> 04:48.830
to show that in our country the mindset is that we love imported things if it is from Germany China

04:48.830 --> 04:56.630
or USA or any other country people are going to have more value to them attaching more value to them.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.800
So this is actually the tagline and showing the message.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.350
Okay.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.410
Then we have on the right you can see log in and create new account credit.

05:04.430 --> 05:11.360
Then sign up because when we were studying for the first time user interview with my users most of the

05:11.360 --> 05:13.010
users they didn't understand.

05:13.010 --> 05:16.610
Sign up things so they think that it is also logging.

05:16.610 --> 05:19.700
So I change it to create new account rather than sign it.

05:19.730 --> 05:22.430
Then we have log in which is very common.

05:22.580 --> 05:31.700
Then we have these two things call help line or sound data done which is actually assuring because I

05:31.700 --> 05:39.320
have seen that in the user interview we had users thinking that this site is not trustable because they

05:39.320 --> 05:41.420
are not showing any return policy.

05:41.450 --> 05:47.960
So we make sure that we have some written policy overhead then we have over here the card which is showing

05:47.960 --> 05:53.390
clearly eight items and we have a big search bar which user is going to expect on the right side.

05:53.930 --> 06:00.230
I have seen a lot of websites that they use and such bars on the left which is not a very common place

06:00.230 --> 06:02.030
for that search box.

06:02.030 --> 06:09.440
We will have some dropdown or such suggestions anyhow here we have the main page items I have added

06:09.730 --> 06:16.640
a home over here because most of the users in my country they don't know if they click on this logo

06:16.670 --> 06:17.830
they will go back to home.

06:18.320 --> 06:25.850
So I have added a home categories because most of the users if they are lost they are going to go back

06:25.850 --> 06:26.700
to home.

06:26.870 --> 06:32.750
Then we have deals page which busy moms our persona which was looking for the deals page.

06:32.780 --> 06:39.430
And we have party dresses which was a selected category when we had a card sorting exercise.

06:39.620 --> 06:44.840
And most of the users the selected party dresses other than fancy dresses then we have casual dresses

06:44.870 --> 06:50.490
then we have Barbie princess frocks so I have used both terms princess and also Barbie.

06:51.180 --> 06:53.080
So this is it.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.610
Then we have main top two sections.

06:55.610 --> 07:01.130
Here we have some other collections you if you remember that I showed you an image of a girl when she

07:01.130 --> 07:02.380
I interviewed her.

07:02.570 --> 07:08.960
She was looking for some of the collection because it was summer right now on the left we have top deals

07:08.980 --> 07:09.480
again.

07:09.500 --> 07:15.920
We are focusing on a deal spared maybe user is going to get more focused on this one rather than clicking

07:15.940 --> 07:19.040
our overhead bottom at the bottom.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.920
We have different dresses which are right not popular.

07:23.030 --> 07:30.680
So let's move bit down a popular dresses and which are mostly bought right now.

07:30.830 --> 07:36.770
So user might be inclined to buy dresses which others are looking at right now or maybe trying to buy

07:36.770 --> 07:37.780
right now.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.540
So these are different dresses.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.570
We can add more categories but this is actually our mean.

07:43.760 --> 07:51.620
You can say focus to cover the first section which is mostly above the fold or in the fall area where

07:51.620 --> 07:54.370
the user is going to mostly browse.

07:54.370 --> 08:00.170
So users if you don't know what is forward forward is actually the top seven or eight hundred pixels

08:00.170 --> 08:03.790
which mostly users browse on a.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.750
It is not the same on your mobile.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.840
Mobile phones will have like four to five hundreds.

08:08.840 --> 08:12.460
And we might have just this section or hair or maybe this one.

08:12.980 --> 08:17.230
So we are going to show these two in the top section OK.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.230
So that is all.

08:18.340 --> 08:24.310
Again we have of Franklin address and phone number at the bottom to make sure that users have something

08:24.310 --> 08:25.130
over here.

08:25.180 --> 08:28.000
Then we have again repeating the same at the footer.

08:28.030 --> 08:32.460
Users are not going to be very much interested in the photo right now.

08:32.470 --> 08:37.990
Also over here we can add something like order via WhatsApp.

08:38.020 --> 08:46.650
So let's add that right now because we found out that users actually love ordering via what's app so

08:46.680 --> 08:50.180
we are going to replicate this by clicking out.

08:50.460 --> 08:55.140
The software is very easy to use I have a free video on my youtube channel if you want to watch how

08:55.410 --> 09:02.310
to use balsamic mockups you can go to my YouTube channel Len you excite me and you can search for wild

09:02.310 --> 09:08.080
frames and you will have a very detailed 15 minutes video on how to use this tool.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.440
So we are going to have order

09:12.990 --> 09:15.480
locks app order

09:18.250 --> 09:22.770
Okay so next Jane the icon over here.

09:22.780 --> 09:32.570
If we have uh um message or things something like this something like this.

09:33.210 --> 09:37.380
Okay so we have something like that or here.

09:37.490 --> 09:45.560
So uh this is going to you know let's move it to this one like go ahead because user is going to look

09:45.560 --> 09:51.510
on the light right side and the control and more so that is it.

09:51.510 --> 09:58.680
I think this is our wireframe and I have shown you all the decisions we have made why actually we are

09:58.680 --> 10:03.840
using these categories over here because we found out in our card sorting that users are using these

10:03.840 --> 10:10.730
terms to define our different categories of clothes then we have someone collection which uses were

10:10.740 --> 10:16.740
looking for when it comes Vinter we are going to show the vendor or we can sure like three columns over

10:16.740 --> 10:22.860
here and we can also show rental because sometimes users might want to look for winter collection before

10:22.860 --> 10:26.380
they even though before the winter is going to come.

10:26.400 --> 10:26.630
Okay.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.360
So again we have all these.

10:30.360 --> 10:37.890
If you have any questions regarding why and how I created this whole wireframe and what other decisions

10:38.280 --> 10:46.290
we had you can see in the d d I have 90 percent off which is a very good call to action that please

10:46.290 --> 10:47.520
buy this.

10:47.520 --> 10:52.120
Then we have this just arrived which is showing that these are latest designs.

10:52.140 --> 10:58.530
So it is also showing the fabric here you can see made with imported chiffon fabric.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.890
So this is the title of the frock then.

11:01.980 --> 11:10.020
And then we are going to show the the fabric of what it is made of because most women they are mostly

11:10.290 --> 11:12.000
interested in the fabric.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.190
So that is all.

11:13.200 --> 11:19.560
If you have any questions do ask me this is how we went through the whole use Express design process

11:19.560 --> 11:22.260
and created this wireframe of the main page.

11:22.260 --> 11:25.980
We can also create a wireframe of the products page.

11:26.100 --> 11:33.300
And right now I don't have time to create all of vide frames because I the reason is just to teach you

11:33.300 --> 11:40.200
how the use Express process how this information architecture user flows everything is going to help

11:40.200 --> 11:45.920
you decide and make a better user experience for this fraudulent e-commerce Web site.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.900
Let us move on to the next lesson and see what we have ahead.

11:49.980 --> 11:52.080
See you soon in another video you.
