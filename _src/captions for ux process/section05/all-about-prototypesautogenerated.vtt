WEBVTT

00:04.630 --> 00:11.350
No we have already created via frames and via frames are going to tell a lot about what the information

00:11.350 --> 00:16.880
is there present in your pages Web sites or mobile app screens.

00:17.080 --> 00:23.440
But the interactivity how actually those static pages are going to work or interact when what happens

00:23.440 --> 00:25.720
when a user clicks on Add To Cart.

00:25.720 --> 00:31.990
What happens when a user clicks on short details how the whole product is going to work.

00:31.990 --> 00:38.740
So working model which shows mostly that interaction feedback of your system and what are the transitions

00:38.980 --> 00:46.210
between screens and what will happen when some user gets error messages or things like that they are

00:46.210 --> 00:48.400
going to be present in your prototype.

00:48.410 --> 00:54.220
Now these prototypes are bread and butter of George use expense design process and they are the biggest

00:54.220 --> 00:55.090
cost savers.

00:55.090 --> 00:55.570
Why.

00:55.570 --> 01:03.100
Because you can have and develop a prototype or paper prototype with no cost and no time you can create

01:03.100 --> 01:07.090
them in just 30 minutes and you can test your idea and you can throw it away.

01:07.090 --> 01:10.080
These are called through are very prototypes.

01:10.300 --> 01:15.840
You are not going to you know get yourself emotionally involved with the prototypes.

01:15.850 --> 01:18.590
They are just for testing purpose.

01:18.670 --> 01:23.770
They are for making your product better and better you are going to iterate your design and again and

01:23.770 --> 01:27.120
again based on the feedback you get from the users.

01:27.130 --> 01:33.460
When you test your prototypes so try to create prototypes as early as possible in your user expense

01:33.460 --> 01:39.940
design process even you can use them in user interviews and let's see some of the different types of

01:39.940 --> 01:47.670
prototypes which I have already covered in my Adobe x d course design prototype and collaborate.

01:48.040 --> 01:55.020
But I am going to cover it over here again because it is more related to this course than Adobe equity.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.100
There are three major types of prototypes.

01:58.240 --> 02:04.000
One are paper prototypes which are most easier to produce you can use just the papers use some markers

02:04.000 --> 02:05.860
and things and create paper prototypes.

02:05.860 --> 02:12.310
Then we have digital prototypes or interactive prototypes which users can easily tap on and click on

02:12.340 --> 02:16.240
and you can move from screen to screen with some transition some effects.

02:16.240 --> 02:20.940
There are many tools brought up by principal Flynn to be equity.

02:20.950 --> 02:24.210
These are all the tools you can use to create digital prototypes.

02:24.250 --> 02:33.220
Then we have developed prototypes like you can see we mostly use them in a jail you X where we just

02:33.750 --> 02:37.230
release or lead the better vision or alpha version of our product.

02:37.240 --> 02:42.220
And just to test it the how will be the response of the users what will happen.

02:42.250 --> 02:49.030
So if you remember that Invision studio they started with and we a studio is a unique design app.

02:49.030 --> 02:54.490
If you don't know and they started with an invite of testing that beta product and once you get the

02:54.490 --> 02:59.740
invite they send you a link to test it and you give them feedback that half of what you think about

02:59.740 --> 03:01.040
their product.

03:01.060 --> 03:04.150
So this is a good way but it is a bit costly.

03:04.150 --> 03:10.040
So if you are trying to develop a prototype using some chords it will have some cost.

03:10.270 --> 03:18.370
Now horizontal prototype as the name suggests that it has horizontal features means that it has all

03:18.370 --> 03:23.200
the features but you are not testing each feature in depth.

03:23.290 --> 03:30.810
For example the main screens on main pages of any website they are mostly going to fall into this category

03:30.820 --> 03:34.990
horizontal prototypes because they are a lot of options to choose from.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.680
User can click on these if you have seen.

03:37.750 --> 03:44.340
Remember the VAR frames of my website user can click on anything but they are not going to go to checkout

03:44.380 --> 03:47.080
page each time via each bot.

03:47.170 --> 03:53.570
So you are actually testing a lot of different things but you are not going into depth.

03:53.680 --> 04:01.810
So this is actually like you are not going to show all the process or all the prototype behind ordering

04:01.810 --> 04:02.710
a frog.

04:02.710 --> 04:09.960
You might have just need to test for example if I have placed some other collection on the first page.

04:10.150 --> 04:13.840
Whether the users are going to first click that or not.

04:13.840 --> 04:20.050
So this is actually horizontal prototype is actually going to check your you can see empty doors.

04:20.110 --> 04:24.880
So you just place few empty doors in your app or in your browser.

04:24.880 --> 04:33.760
Like if you have recently used YouTube there was an empty button which does nothing and when you click

04:33.760 --> 04:41.950
on it it shows you that this feature is coming soon and you will say what what the heck what is happening.

04:41.950 --> 04:44.600
And they placed it just to test the user.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.600
That user is actually interested in this feature or not.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.560
So this is actually horizontal prototype.

04:50.560 --> 04:57.580
You placed a lot of features just to see which one attracts more to the user and you are not going to

04:57.820 --> 05:03.200
check the check functionality in depth of each feature.

05:03.260 --> 05:04.730
Then we have vertical prototypes.

05:04.730 --> 05:09.700
They are going to go deep into any feature you are testing for example.

05:09.740 --> 05:14.060
I go from main page and then I'm going to go to the whole checkout process.

05:14.180 --> 05:20.510
So if we have a perfect eye that shows the whole checkout process this is a vertical prototype for checkout.

05:20.510 --> 05:23.060
So these are not different things.

05:23.060 --> 05:30.380
You can see if I try to create ordering process ordering vert vertical prototype then I'm going to show

05:30.650 --> 05:38.030
how the user is going to go from browsing dress to ordering a dress and adding it to cart and things

05:38.030 --> 05:38.850
like that.

05:38.990 --> 05:45.320
And for example if we have like log in or sign up vertical prototype then we are going to go into details

05:45.740 --> 05:54.260
of what if a user get some error message or user is already logged on as user already have an account

05:54.260 --> 05:58.240
or one of what if he or she forgets the account.

05:58.580 --> 06:07.370
So the vertical prototype will have all the details of a single feature or function then DB prototype

06:07.370 --> 06:11.600
is actually combining both horizontal and vertical prototypes.

06:11.630 --> 06:19.250
So it has it is going to cover a broad functions but it is going to test just one or two of them into

06:19.250 --> 06:26.030
depth so I'm going to show you at the end of this lesson my prototype which I have used to just test

06:26.180 --> 06:33.290
my searching function and I used Adobe to create that prototype and you will really leverage so you

06:33.290 --> 06:39.560
can just test two or three things out of your whole app which are most important for your user and you

06:39.560 --> 06:43.890
think that are going to make or break your app or website.

06:44.010 --> 06:44.260
Okay.

06:44.270 --> 06:50.060
Now in the last we have local prototypes local prototypes means that they are going to reside on a single

06:50.060 --> 06:57.380
screen single web page and they are more focused on detail on a single aspect of that page.

06:57.440 --> 07:03.260
For example you might have seen a b testing where we test that the button and the label of the button

07:03.260 --> 07:09.190
should be add to cart or add to shopping bag or by now and we will see the results.

07:09.500 --> 07:17.060
And by testing on different sections or you can see different portions of users and see which is going

07:17.060 --> 07:17.480
to win.

07:17.480 --> 07:24.500
So a b testing if you have heard that we actually created two versions of the same page or two versions

07:24.500 --> 07:32.750
of the same screen and show half of the users one version and half of the users one version and see

07:32.750 --> 07:37.270
which one is going to win and which one is going to get us more sales.

07:37.580 --> 07:43.010
So it is about how we are going to have more converted users more and more money.

07:43.010 --> 07:50.530
So it is a bit a little bit of different kind of testing so I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.440
Now let's see Dad.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.200
Prototype I created using Adobe equity.

07:55.260 --> 08:00.320
If you are interested in joining Adobe equity you can take my course of Adobe XP.

08:00.450 --> 08:03.920
You can see I really love to advertise about my courses.

08:03.940 --> 08:08.520
Anyhow let's move through it all back and see what I have created.

08:08.520 --> 08:12.000
Now we are in Adobe city and you can see here is my prototype.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.730
Here we have like 10 different screens.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.170
Five six seven eight nine ten.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.350
Okay so they are actually 10 anyhow.

08:19.350 --> 08:27.000
So these are different screens and prototype is going to this prototype resembles almost a final product

08:27.010 --> 08:33.120
so I'm going to show you now I'm going to play this and let's see how it looks like and how it plays

08:33.120 --> 08:33.920
out.

08:34.350 --> 08:37.460
Anyhow so we have this main page we have search.

08:37.470 --> 08:40.330
We have this menu bar which is not working.

08:40.410 --> 08:41.660
So it does de prototype.

08:41.670 --> 08:45.300
We have just few functionalities working overhead not everything else.

08:45.330 --> 08:45.680
OK.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.140
So we can.

08:48.140 --> 08:52.570
A user can go to these by no press over here okay.

08:52.580 --> 08:57.640
So we have this page we can select the size.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.670
We can click on by now.

09:00.930 --> 09:02.850
A message appears and disappears.

09:02.850 --> 09:07.500
Keep shopping or you want to go to check out so we are going to go to check out because it is more about

09:07.500 --> 09:08.670
checkout process.

09:08.850 --> 09:11.080
So we will all our card.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.360
So this is my card.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.420
I viewed all my card if I want to remove remove.

09:15.420 --> 09:19.830
It's not working so there are a few functionalities we are testing over here.

09:19.830 --> 09:25.050
Then we are going to select our payment method from these three payment methods which are very common

09:25.050 --> 09:26.270
in my country.

09:26.310 --> 09:27.050
Easy BSR.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.340
You'll be an omni and be at your doorstep which is the most common.

09:30.340 --> 09:36.120
I placed it at the bottom so user can tap it with his or her fingers easily.

09:36.270 --> 09:37.110
It is reachable.

09:37.110 --> 09:44.700
It is accessible if you want to learn more about usability accessibility user behavior and how psychology

09:44.700 --> 09:46.110
affects the user experience.

09:46.110 --> 09:52.530
There is a separate course from me which is on user experience principle models and behaviors user behaviors

09:53.220 --> 09:58.230
anyhow so we are going to go to confirm orders tanks and confirm order text.

09:58.230 --> 10:01.730
You will receive estimates on your number this one.

10:01.920 --> 10:07.710
And now we are going to go back to home and we have another functionality so this is a deep prototype.

10:07.730 --> 10:08.070
OK.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.730
So we have two functionalities over here in depth.

10:10.740 --> 10:14.310
We have search now and you can see we have such a lot here.

10:14.310 --> 10:20.280
We have different popular searches which are suggestions and we are going to pick one of them which

10:20.280 --> 10:21.620
is Barbie dress.

10:21.780 --> 10:26.130
And there are different results showing about this.

10:26.180 --> 10:31.430
Case so we didn't go in depth with the result filters because this is another page.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.210
This is another topic or you can see I didn't have time for that one.

10:36.240 --> 10:41.880
So this is a search functionality we can load more reserves we have add to cart we have different color

10:41.910 --> 10:45.610
options available over here we have price and title.

10:45.710 --> 10:52.350
So this is all about how you can create prototype and tested with users.

10:52.350 --> 10:58.560
So might be user might be looking for fabric type or hair so once they go to this filter results we

10:58.560 --> 11:06.180
have places where we can add like cotton fabric or something like that or maybe we can add or hair that

11:06.870 --> 11:12.850
it is a phone or this is the material of the cloth or things like that you can wear it in some hours

11:12.870 --> 11:14.800
or maybe things like that.

11:15.060 --> 11:19.610
So filters will be separate which I didn't have time to create.

11:19.770 --> 11:26.190
Anyhow this is a prototype I created I hope you love this lecture of prototyping and how I actually

11:26.190 --> 11:27.660
created this prototype.

11:27.660 --> 11:33.960
You can build it using principle and there is another apparatus by I am planning to create another course

11:33.960 --> 11:39.170
on just this prototyping and I hope to see you soon in that one too anyhow.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.840
So this is all about prototyping and user experience design.

11:42.840 --> 11:47.270
If you have any questions to ask me let's move on to the next listen.
