00:04.450 --> 00:10.750
Know in the last I'm going to talk about the detailed specs and brought out detailed specifications

00:11.170 --> 00:16.020
of all your system your app your website or web app.

00:16.020 --> 00:23.980
Now detailed specifications are sometimes necessary venue or whatever you are designing for example

00:23.980 --> 00:31.030
if you are designing an airline software which is going to be installed on airplanes and you can see

00:31.060 --> 00:39.910
that airplane are aviation technology which is very you can say detail and you have to get each and

00:39.910 --> 00:43.380
every step and details because it is about the safety.

00:43.540 --> 00:51.580
It is a critical app because your app can make a plane crash and hundreds of people are going to lose

00:51.580 --> 00:52.930
their lives.

00:52.990 --> 00:57.100
So your dis user experience design process will be very elaborate.

00:57.100 --> 01:03.760
You are going to have very detailed specifications you are going to generate tasks and functionality

01:04.150 --> 01:05.160
of each app.

01:05.170 --> 01:11.800
The whole interaction everything in detail your user expense design process might take a whole year

01:12.440 --> 01:18.730
at twelve months or maybe more than that to develop that design specifications and develop that actual

01:18.730 --> 01:19.830
app.

01:19.960 --> 01:25.870
Now here we are going to work with your developer and development team to create all these specs because

01:25.870 --> 01:32.050
sometimes there is miscommunication between designers as Europeans designers and developers so try to

01:32.050 --> 01:41.500
communicate with them normally in all other designs mostly which are not you can say very critical apps

01:41.800 --> 01:45.880
where we have life saving a life threatening apps things like that.

01:45.940 --> 01:52.000
We have mostly specs which are going to have high fidelity mockups which are original designs.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.500
We will have wire frames we will have interactive prototypes to show then we will have dos inventory

01:58.500 --> 02:01.260
diagrams side maps and user floors.

02:01.270 --> 02:07.900
So these are actually the major diagrams of things maybe your system model the whole the whole system

02:07.900 --> 02:11.550
model who is it is a whole it is going to work things like that.

02:11.560 --> 02:19.290
Maybe you use guesses but I normally don't use used guesses and most of the time and on the business

02:19.290 --> 02:25.750
side you might have visibility or reports or your limitations or cost or things like that.

02:25.750 --> 02:29.910
Maybe strategy your plan of having different features at different times.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.000
Things like that.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.770
These are different things you are going to generate in user expense design process.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.080
At the end.

02:36.270 --> 02:37.410
Now let's see why.

02:37.410 --> 02:44.370
Actually we are going to deliver these detailed specs and in what are the aspects we are going to cover

02:44.460 --> 02:46.100
in our specs.

02:46.110 --> 02:48.270
Now this is actually very important.

02:48.300 --> 02:56.520
You have to you know create an image of this one into your minds into your tiny tiny or large brains

02:57.050 --> 02:58.090
anyhow.

02:58.230 --> 03:06.090
So we have functionality and features so functionality and features is actually what is this system

03:06.270 --> 03:07.500
capable of.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.100
So what is this system can do.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.520
So these are actually the features.

03:12.520 --> 03:19.460
For example we are just launching 10 features or five features in our first release of our app.

03:19.470 --> 03:21.680
Then next we have floor of app.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.420
We have navigational pod.

03:23.430 --> 03:29.550
We have information in architecture that is going to cover this section we have guards sorting.

03:29.550 --> 03:32.180
We have user flaws.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.290
We have site maps that are going to cover.

03:34.290 --> 03:39.380
Then we have interactivity we I have already showed you a prototype which was deeper today.

03:39.390 --> 03:46.200
We're going to show our developers rather than telling them in a long detailed document that this is

03:46.200 --> 03:47.850
how it should work.

03:47.850 --> 03:50.670
This is how user is going to get error messages.

03:50.670 --> 03:53.440
This is how users are going to log in.

03:53.460 --> 03:59.280
So these are interactive prototypes we are going to have then we are going to develop site map which

03:59.280 --> 04:06.930
is also going to show the boundary of app or website that this is the broad spectrum image of your whole

04:06.930 --> 04:08.160
pages and sub pages.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.780
These are actually the pages that are going to be produced by a web developer.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.330
Then we have detailed wireframe.

04:14.340 --> 04:22.560
So we also want to make sure the content and how that content has been organized on each page how the

04:22.560 --> 04:28.740
product page is showing the details of your product or addresses what is present or what their colors

04:29.190 --> 04:33.020
the sizes the size guide are.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.470
We have fabric type.

04:34.470 --> 04:41.340
These things are easily viewable or easily you can say readable for use users.

04:41.340 --> 04:47.090
Does that those make sense that does the user really need this content detail.

04:47.100 --> 04:52.650
We are going to check all that messaging and details of our content in Wired frames.

04:52.650 --> 04:58.500
So that is all about detailed specs and what should be in your detailed specs and what should be in

04:58.500 --> 05:05.190
your deliverables when you are ending a user experience design process and you are delivering your documents

05:05.190 --> 05:10.920
and whatever research or things you have created to your design and development team mostly you are

05:10.920 --> 05:15.930
going to work together with them you are not going to just deliver them the documents and go home and

05:15.930 --> 05:21.000
sleep and just the work they are going to do you are going to collaborate them on a daily basis you

05:21.000 --> 05:25.590
are going to go to them and see the progress on each step.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.110
Show me what you have done right now.

05:27.140 --> 05:31.280
No this is not the user want see this document over there.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.500
The user interview we did for the first end user.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.660
This is the requirement we got.

05:36.660 --> 05:41.660
You are making and you are not making the right sense or right use of that.

05:41.670 --> 05:47.160
So this is actually going to happen because before implementation or coding you are going you have more

05:47.160 --> 05:53.640
time and you can easily save cost if you try to you know interfere in that.

05:53.640 --> 05:59.580
So try to collaborate with your developers your design team you are a huge expense designer you might

05:59.580 --> 06:03.360
have some design experience so you will be working closely with developers.

06:03.480 --> 06:09.900
So that is all you are also going to include your CEO because they also have a lot and marketing team

06:09.930 --> 06:14.630
because they have a lot of more insight into customers and their purchasing behavior.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.160
So that is all.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.960
If you have any questions to ask me.

06:18.030 --> 06:19.920
Let's move on to the next lesson.
