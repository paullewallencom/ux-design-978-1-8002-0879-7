00:04.570 --> 00:10.990
In this video we are going to talk about user flaws and site maps and I am also going to share with

00:10.990 --> 00:19.920
you an online tool that can easily help you generate user flows and site maps visually and very easily.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.920
You just need to drag and drop and that's it.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.250
And it has a free version too.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.480
So we are not worried about being anything.

00:26.830 --> 00:28.740
So let's get started.

00:28.750 --> 00:35.440
First we are going to see what are user flaws and why they are important.

00:35.440 --> 00:42.100
Now flow off your Web site and your app is actually a part of information architecture how the user

00:42.130 --> 00:47.000
is going to move from one page to another or from one screen to another.

00:47.110 --> 00:55.500
Which part they are going to take and how actually user reaches a certain portion of for example a checkout

00:55.510 --> 00:58.660
page how this person is going to reach that.

00:59.470 --> 01:07.240
Similarly we have very common flaws like we have checkout floors we have log in sign up floors we have

01:07.300 --> 01:13.960
onboarding user flow when the user is actually starting or installing our app or website for the first

01:13.960 --> 01:14.610
time.

01:14.620 --> 01:19.090
So this is actually onboarding so we are onboarding them that holiday.

01:19.210 --> 01:24.930
What is this website or app is about and how they are going to get value from it.

01:24.940 --> 01:28.050
So this is these are common user flows.

01:28.180 --> 01:33.430
You can design user flows for your whole website for each process and it is very simple.

01:33.460 --> 01:38.170
It is actually just deciding how the user will reach the information.

01:38.170 --> 01:45.310
Similarly we have site maps that are mostly related to web sites and why actually we create a map of

01:45.670 --> 01:52.960
Web site and all its pages because the users and search engines they can find the information or what

01:52.960 --> 01:54.600
they are looking for easily.

01:54.610 --> 02:01.630
So we actually map out create a map of all the pages and sub pages off your Web site and we put it in

02:01.630 --> 02:08.620
a 1 1 page or sometimes a 1 diagram to show that this is how our whole website structure is going to

02:08.620 --> 02:09.380
layout.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.800
So this will be our page structure.

02:11.800 --> 02:19.660
This is how we are actually have different structures or you can say like if we talk about architecture

02:20.500 --> 02:26.770
we have a house and we have different rooms and then within those rooms we have different smaller loan

02:26.860 --> 02:32.900
rooms like washrooms bathrooms or toilets and dressing rooms.

02:32.950 --> 02:35.640
So in the kitchen we have dining room.

02:35.680 --> 02:42.220
So this is similar to how actually you are going to map out a house or your home.

02:42.220 --> 02:47.950
So we are actually have big rooms like Bill and pages then we have child pages that are sub rooms or

02:47.950 --> 02:54.190
sub smaller rooms of smaller portions inside that same category.

02:54.190 --> 02:59.290
And it is actually how our whole website is actually going to have a structure.

02:59.440 --> 03:06.400
So search engines mostly Google they have crawlers that are basically softwares that actually go to

03:06.400 --> 03:11.360
your Web site and they crawl different pages and get information from them.

03:11.380 --> 03:18.220
So site map and planning out how you are going to structure a Web site has a great impact on your marketing

03:18.220 --> 03:23.590
and your search engine optimization how your website is going to appear in search engines.

03:23.590 --> 03:25.020
So this is very important part.

03:25.030 --> 03:32.790
If you are designing or developing for our website so let's see a tool that I recommend you can use

03:32.790 --> 03:36.570
for creating site maps and user flows.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.180
So this is an app called Flow map.

03:39.180 --> 03:46.320
And this is just for site maps and user flows and it has a free vision and free sign up.

03:46.320 --> 03:53.780
So here I have created this site map and you can see this is a site map for fraud plan.

03:53.790 --> 03:55.480
Let me go to this view.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.050
It is very simple.

03:57.210 --> 04:03.060
What you have to do is just you have to click go ahead and there will be different pages you can add

04:03.060 --> 04:09.180
from that for example if I want to add more pages for example Lexi we have Rockland main page.

04:09.180 --> 04:13.250
Let's zoom in a bit OK.

04:13.810 --> 04:15.700
So we are now zoomed in.

04:15.730 --> 04:18.400
Let's drag it up Falkland main page.

04:18.430 --> 04:19.900
Then we have some pages deal.

04:19.900 --> 04:22.810
It deals bid and browse products with categories.

04:22.810 --> 04:28.030
So whatever category they are going to select all here it will be a category page with filters you can

04:28.030 --> 04:28.800
see on the left.

04:28.800 --> 04:33.360
We have small filters then we have contact us page log and sign up page.

04:33.370 --> 04:40.450
I am just you know making sure that you understand what is this concept then from these two pages we

04:40.450 --> 04:42.770
have product details product item.

04:42.940 --> 04:49.930
And this is the same product page product details page from deals page or product with this or this

04:49.930 --> 04:52.320
browse product page.

04:52.330 --> 04:55.230
So users will go from here to this page.

04:55.330 --> 04:58.860
This is a common page then we can add to cart.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.820
And here we have our cart.

05:00.850 --> 05:06.610
Then we have checkout process than we had and have to select payment options then we have order success

05:06.610 --> 05:06.860
page.

05:06.850 --> 05:13.390
So these are all the different pages we have listed a lot here as you can also list different category

05:13.390 --> 05:14.080
pages over here.

05:14.080 --> 05:21.300
For example in my case of Franklin I can add a few more pages by clicking this one or here.

05:21.520 --> 05:31.640
And I have a few more categories like let me add a catalog over here at bridge and we have a new page.

05:31.640 --> 05:37.300
Let's name it princess dresses.

05:37.500 --> 05:37.840
OK.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.740
So we have this one more page or ahead.

05:40.790 --> 05:41.830
Let's move it.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.250
It's let me see.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.900
I'm not sure why it is you know structuring like this.

05:46.910 --> 05:50.210
Anyhow it is choosing it automatically.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.400
Then we can add one more category.

05:52.410 --> 05:59.890
Page let's add one more category and we are going to add another one.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.210
This will be casual dresses.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.440
OK so you got the idea.

06:07.440 --> 06:12.810
This is how you are going to create a site map and you can export it all.

06:12.810 --> 06:15.360
Here you can see here we have export options.

06:15.420 --> 06:20.610
We have SVP Angie I'm going to use BMG and generate preview.

06:20.610 --> 06:23.260
Let's see how the preview looks like.

06:23.460 --> 06:30.100
This is not actually smart so far AB but actually I cannot create a new project as I am on a free vision.

06:30.330 --> 06:39.870
So let's export as BMG so you can have this BMG and you can use it and show it in your portfolios and

06:39.870 --> 06:45.330
just generate site map like this one and it will look great similarly.

06:45.330 --> 06:49.670
Let me move again to that same spot.

06:49.710 --> 06:57.510
And let's go back where we can go back here or we can go back and sign in again.

06:57.540 --> 07:01.970
Not sure how you have to go back over there anyhow.

07:02.090 --> 07:05.880
So now we are moving to use a floor so use a floor.

07:05.880 --> 07:15.740
Here we have the user floor and you can see there are different rectangles and then we have this kind

07:15.740 --> 07:18.790
of triangle type shape.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.040
It has it is actually a decision.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.480
So this is a process.

07:23.510 --> 07:32.850
So I am actually not using most of you can say I'm next some of this and most of the things all here

07:32.890 --> 07:37.590
I think George user flow must be very simple.

07:38.010 --> 07:41.040
So just think that this is a screen right now.

07:41.070 --> 07:45.450
I'm just showing you will use a floor for an app I designed.

07:45.450 --> 07:47.530
This is a user fro welcome screen.

07:47.610 --> 07:48.960
Then we have have you.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.470
Do you have an account.

07:50.760 --> 07:54.790
If you do have an account you are going to log in you can see it here then.

07:54.930 --> 07:59.000
This is actually if you don't have an account you are going to create a new account.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.390
Then again you are going to log in.

08:00.720 --> 08:05.650
So once you have been logged in you can connect your smart so far.

08:05.650 --> 08:06.780
Why are Bluetooth.

08:07.130 --> 08:07.440
OK.

08:07.740 --> 08:13.260
So if your Bluetooth is already turned on you are going to go to the introduction to sofa controls and

08:13.260 --> 08:14.560
this will be the end.

08:14.700 --> 08:20.640
And if you are not connected with Bluetooth so far this is actually the other part you are going to

08:20.640 --> 08:23.220
connect your Bluetooth if not connected.

08:23.250 --> 08:31.230
So the message will appear and you will again be connected to the Bluetooth and again go to this same

08:31.230 --> 08:32.010
screen.

08:32.010 --> 08:37.160
So this is actually onboarding user flow for a smart so far app.

08:37.230 --> 08:39.000
When the user first starts their team.

08:39.330 --> 08:44.530
But this is the smart so far and they try to open the app for the first time.

08:44.610 --> 08:47.040
This is going to what happened with them.

08:47.040 --> 08:51.830
So there are actually two decisions or two things they are actually making over here.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.340
One is do you have an account.

08:53.340 --> 08:57.840
And second is whether you are connected with a so far Bluetooth or not.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.800
So there are two parts with that.

08:59.820 --> 09:05.820
So whenever you have some selection or you have something to decide with you are going to use this kind

09:05.820 --> 09:07.610
of symbol lower ahead.

09:07.650 --> 09:08.770
I'm not sure why.

09:08.770 --> 09:13.450
Actually it has been there was something over here.

09:13.480 --> 09:13.900
Let me show.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.570
Okay so once I click over here.

09:15.580 --> 09:20.170
So if I click or here I can change it to this decision symbol.

09:20.570 --> 09:21.430
Okay.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.520
So we have something like that or here.

09:23.970 --> 09:24.180
Okay.

09:24.190 --> 09:27.050
So once you have me made this so it is very easy.

09:27.070 --> 09:33.070
All the controls are at the bottom if you want to change something just click on it and you can have

09:33.070 --> 09:35.770
another you can see a color or hair.

09:35.770 --> 09:39.040
For example I want to show green for the connected again.

09:39.100 --> 09:44.870
I wanted to show green or hair for the connected and it is going to show green or here.

09:45.850 --> 09:46.140
Okay.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.160
So that is all.

09:48.160 --> 09:54.740
It is very easy to create and there are a lot of different more examples of very simple user flaws I'm

09:54.760 --> 09:57.110
going to show you which others have created.

09:57.220 --> 10:03.280
You don't need this app if you want to create it in sketch it'll be actually Photoshop whatever tool

10:03.280 --> 10:06.550
you have or even paper or pencil you can do that.

10:06.550 --> 10:08.730
So here is another example of user flow.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.590
I found it on a b b.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.470
I'm not sure who designed it so I'm not taking the credit.

10:14.140 --> 10:17.080
So you can see kids dashboard car customization.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.170
So this is actually two things.

10:19.210 --> 10:26.820
It is showing that on a parent's dashboard we have flaws like we can go to kids profile kids task or

10:26.830 --> 10:27.460
confirmation.

10:27.460 --> 10:33.190
So these are two things where you can do also destroying that log out of ensure the confirmation your

10:33.190 --> 10:37.780
kid you are going to select the kid and then the kid's profile.

10:37.780 --> 10:41.590
So this these this is another kind of user flow.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.740
This is another kind which is very simple.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.160
I really love it.

10:45.160 --> 10:53.110
It is what actually shows a user flow onboarding and authorization sign up sign in for guard password.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.810
So this is actually a good example.

10:55.810 --> 11:00.910
So it is actually reversing again and again if you forgot the password you have to sign in again from

11:00.910 --> 11:08.350
the e-mail you get anyhow sign up create an upload photo documents add a withdrawal method choose Texas

11:08.350 --> 11:09.710
surveys homepage.

11:09.760 --> 11:15.060
So this is actually a user flow of a whole app not just one process.

11:15.100 --> 11:21.880
So from onboarding to choosing a taxi home going to home page news and did profile there are a lot of

11:21.880 --> 11:22.980
things going on here.

11:23.410 --> 11:27.850
I don't recommend that you create two big user flaws.

11:27.880 --> 11:33.250
I think it is better if you keep your focus on one or two processes rather than a very big user flow.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.640
So create like three or four user flaws.

11:35.800 --> 11:42.400
Different user flows and divide your whole big app into four different user flows that would be great.

11:42.450 --> 11:49.950
Here's a user flow I created using Adobe equity which is designed to you a design tool and this is more

11:50.030 --> 11:56.230
busy mom user flow and you can see I use that user flow for a chequered process a busy mom would have.

11:56.230 --> 11:58.070
So it is actually attached to a persona.

11:58.270 --> 12:00.600
Main Page deals page product details.

12:00.610 --> 12:03.420
This is how this user is going to reach the information.

12:03.640 --> 12:08.910
So they are more inclined to go to deals page rather than browsing products product details view car

12:08.950 --> 12:13.990
check out check checkout with mobile number checkout with logging face Facebook.

12:14.140 --> 12:19.840
Then we have both these pages going to receive order confirmation estimates for each and email.

12:19.840 --> 12:28.540
So this is a very simple process very simple layout saying what actually the user flow must do.

12:28.540 --> 12:37.360
This is how you as user flows must look like and work like it is very easy I just created using wireframe

12:37.600 --> 12:41.890
free violence via framing it I'm going to share the link with you.

12:41.950 --> 12:47.320
So do try to download that and if you have Adobe equity which is a free tool I have a full course on

12:47.320 --> 12:47.590
that.

12:47.590 --> 12:53.890
If you don't know it is very easy to use and it is becoming most popular with within user expense design

12:53.890 --> 12:59.380
community in your design community you can download that and use that to create something similar like

12:59.380 --> 13:10.060
this one all you can use any app you want and I hope you the best and we really see you soon in the

13:10.510 --> 13:11.530
next lesson.
