WEBVTT

00:05.060 --> 00:14.810
We as human beings we love stories from past when we were used to live in caves and you know we used

00:14.900 --> 00:22.700
really were Hunter hunter gatherers we used to love stories so users saw a scenario is basically a short

00:22.830 --> 00:31.160
user story in which we will describe how the user is going to use your product van and in which circumstances

00:31.160 --> 00:36.920
which conditions which problems they were using your product and what they were facing and things like

00:36.920 --> 00:37.170
that.

00:37.170 --> 00:44.720
So it is just a short story built on the context and behavior of your user why is using your product

00:44.750 --> 00:47.910
or a similar product like yours.

00:47.900 --> 00:55.430
So we are going to you know get more information about the usage and the context and user behavior from

00:55.430 --> 00:57.810
these charge user scenarios.

00:57.890 --> 01:01.880
Now there are few doors and dos of user scenarios.

01:01.880 --> 01:09.780
So when you are building or writing a user scenario you are not going to tell each step performed by

01:09.780 --> 01:11.770
a user that she clicked.

01:11.900 --> 01:19.710
Now add to cart button then she clicked check out then she clicked something as then an error.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.770
Then an error happened and she tried to remove it and things like that.

01:24.980 --> 01:28.640
You are not going to tell each and every step taken.

01:28.720 --> 01:28.940
Okay.

01:28.970 --> 01:33.600
So it is a short story we are going to write it in a story format.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.160
We are not going to elaborate each and every step taken by the user.

01:38.420 --> 01:46.160
Now the things we are looking for in a user scenario is goals of our users motivations triggers.

01:46.200 --> 01:46.780
Why.

01:46.770 --> 01:50.660
Actually they are going to put JS this frock.

01:50.780 --> 01:52.510
What are their expectations.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.540
What are their actions.

01:53.540 --> 01:59.590
They are taking what happened what is happening with them but they are frustrated or things like that.

01:59.780 --> 02:02.760
So we are also going to look at the context.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.850
For example she was sitting in her home.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.980
Was she using our e-commerce mobile app.

02:09.980 --> 02:16.970
Was she trying to use it on Internet Explorer using her P.C. was she on a laptop.

02:16.970 --> 02:17.900
So things like that.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.090
So this is actually the context.

02:20.210 --> 02:22.670
Let's see the pass off user scenario.

02:22.670 --> 02:26.100
Now here are some building blocks of a user scenario.

02:26.120 --> 02:33.660
First thing is that we are going to use and attach a persona to a user's Nadia's story short story.

02:33.800 --> 02:40.280
We are not writing like Gene was using things like that we are actually using the whole persona.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.480
A group of users and their behavior and we are attaching it to your product.

02:45.140 --> 02:48.440
Similarly we are going to go for motivation and triggers.

02:48.470 --> 02:48.860
Why.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.990
Actually they started this behavior.

02:50.990 --> 02:51.360
Why.

02:51.360 --> 02:57.720
Actually they were purchasing what happened why they were looking for shirts.

02:57.730 --> 02:59.950
Add that to him at night.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.880
Things like that.

03:01.680 --> 03:08.640
Then we are also going to see the problems they face during the usage or user scenario how they actually

03:08.640 --> 03:15.210
used it whether they were they were facing some problems in the meter maid or at the end and they were

03:15.210 --> 03:16.400
satisfied or nah.

03:16.410 --> 03:17.730
Things like that.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.550
Also what is the problem.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.690
They are trying to solve.

03:20.700 --> 03:26.920
Is there any particular problem in their mind that I want to solve this I want to do this or this is

03:26.920 --> 03:27.930
my problem.

03:27.930 --> 03:35.940
Maybe they are purchasing this frock for some other reason maybe they want to order it for some party

03:35.940 --> 03:41.600
or things like that so you need to find that problem what is the problem they are trying to solve.

03:42.640 --> 03:49.450
Here is one example of user scenario using my product which is actually from clan an e-commerce store

03:49.450 --> 03:51.340
for little goods.

03:51.340 --> 03:56.740
So here is a user scenario I am going to show you another example of the same user scenario with some

03:56.740 --> 04:03.760
other ending so there could be a lot of user scenarios which are related to different tasks and different

04:03.760 --> 04:04.740
personas.

04:04.750 --> 04:08.220
So right now I am using a persona off a busy mom.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.900
So here it goes.

04:10.150 --> 04:16.900
It's late night Zana a busy mom which is a persona needs to go to her office early in the morning so

04:16.900 --> 04:18.710
you can see this is the need.

04:18.730 --> 04:21.200
This is actually their behavior.

04:21.210 --> 04:21.590
Why.

04:21.590 --> 04:26.580
Actually they want to buy their dress because they they want to get off.

04:27.040 --> 04:34.030
You can say that the burden of there is just that they want to buy it so they can easily relax and work

04:34.060 --> 04:36.070
in office without any distraction.

04:36.880 --> 04:43.500
But before that she needs to order a blue princess dress for her daughter so you can see blue Princess

04:43.510 --> 04:45.790
means we are highlighting Blue.

04:45.790 --> 04:53.360
Blue is actually the color so most of the e-commerce stores they don't have filtration based on colors.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.250
So we are going to highlight that because this is a user need.

04:57.250 --> 05:04.810
And this is really it can be a really great feature in our frocks and e-commerce store because it was

05:05.150 --> 05:06.730
our daughter's first day at school.

05:06.730 --> 05:08.640
She took her cell phone.

05:08.830 --> 05:14.680
You can see this is the context so how actually they are going to use our product and search for Barbie

05:14.680 --> 05:15.670
frocks.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.820
So rather than you can see this is user behavior.

05:17.830 --> 05:22.840
They are not going to any website or you want to direct me they are Googling it.

05:22.840 --> 05:29.380
They are searching for Barbie frocks and we are also going to look at and use this term because when

05:29.380 --> 05:36.940
I was doing research user research when I interviewed two users Barbie frocks was a term used for princess

05:36.940 --> 05:39.290
dresses rather than you know princesses.

05:39.310 --> 05:42.910
So they tried to type Barbie frocks.

05:43.030 --> 05:44.920
She clicked Franklin from Google.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.870
This is a scenario of reserves and saw Princess just sections.

05:49.870 --> 05:54.000
She ordered via whatsapp number as it feels easier and quick.

05:54.070 --> 06:02.800
So most of the people in my country they don't you know get very you can say familiar with other payment

06:02.800 --> 06:08.950
options they if they feel that it's easier for them to use whatsapp number as it is direct and if they

06:08.950 --> 06:13.420
want to ask some questions they can ask it to a real person.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.670
So this is the need.

06:15.540 --> 06:21.180
She hopes to get the item delivered by tomorrow so she is right now and she is at the end she is waiting

06:21.180 --> 06:22.030
for her products.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.190
She bought it to get delivered soon.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.630
So this is another thing we need to look for.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.960
Now here we have the same scenario.

06:28.980 --> 06:35.290
Everything is almost the same but you can see at the end this is another behavior they are showing.

06:35.400 --> 06:42.330
She she found princess just section and she didn't find the material of the dress.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.640
So they were looking at this is actually about their selection.

06:46.650 --> 06:51.910
So when they are they have found the product and they are selecting the product.

06:51.930 --> 06:57.230
So this scenario uses scenario is to more about the selection of the product.

06:57.230 --> 07:03.660
So there are different user scenarios for different things like logging might be something else for

07:04.170 --> 07:05.020
Jack.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.760
Check out might be some something some other user scenario.

07:08.760 --> 07:15.450
There have been different problems using that feature Jack out then for sign ups.

07:15.450 --> 07:19.980
There might be some other user scenarios or so for each user.

07:19.980 --> 07:26.100
We are going to have different scenarios so how we actually gathered or make made these scenarios we

07:26.100 --> 07:31.860
actually let our users do this task in the user interviews.

07:31.860 --> 07:41.010
So when you are preparing a user interview actually I showed an open up view you can see a few screens

07:41.010 --> 07:48.420
and let my user do the task so I gave them the tools that you need to order this address for your sister.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.410
How would you do that.

07:49.440 --> 07:49.680
OK.

07:49.710 --> 07:56.870
So go ahead and use my B.S. and do it or how would you do it at your house use your mobile phone.

07:56.890 --> 08:03.130
So this is how actually they did it and they actually tried to do things like that so you can see they

08:03.130 --> 08:09.520
didn't find the material of the address at the end and she wants to make sure that it's gotten and e-mailing

08:09.520 --> 08:16.200
the support at this time of the night was you know was not going to help out because it was with him.

08:16.450 --> 08:17.920
So her problem is not solved.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.980
So in the end she her problem is not solved.

08:20.980 --> 08:24.280
See she is frustrated and things like that.

08:24.310 --> 08:31.690
So this is actually we are going to build in a user scenario persona then their motivation why actually

08:31.690 --> 08:37.180
what is a trigger why they are actually behaving like this then how actually they use the product they

08:37.180 --> 08:44.370
order they use google and things like that they clicked over here the search for these terms then what

08:44.370 --> 08:47.700
was the problem they were facing she didn't find the material of the dress.

08:47.700 --> 08:54.900
This is a problem the first and then in the end what was their feelings at the end what what they frustrated

08:54.930 --> 08:56.010
or things like that.

08:56.040 --> 09:02.960
So this is of users now you I hope you have understood it and I hope you have will have no problem is

09:02.970 --> 09:11.190
using it or making it and there are things you can get from here you can see there are a lot of requirements

09:11.220 --> 09:18.990
and you you can see features of your product which you can extract from user scenario like we have dress

09:19.320 --> 09:26.820
color filters and then we have material filters this is actually what our idea of uniqueness is based

09:26.820 --> 09:30.100
on on about this frock Land project.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.190
So that is all if you have any questions to ask me.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.100
Let's move on to the next lesson.
