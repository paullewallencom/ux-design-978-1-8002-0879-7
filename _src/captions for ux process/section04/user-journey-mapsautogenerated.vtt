00:04.380 --> 00:11.100
Now let's talk about user journey map and I have been asked from a lot of students what these are and

00:11.100 --> 00:19.890
they are actually a simple map and diagram of things your customer is going through while they are engaging

00:19.890 --> 00:28.020
with your company your services your product your web app your mobile app and also we are going to pinpoint

00:28.080 --> 00:36.110
different improvement areas because it is just like you went to a doctor and the doctor asks you where

00:36.400 --> 00:38.730
do you have the pain right now.

00:38.730 --> 00:40.040
Tell me this area.

00:40.200 --> 00:46.740
So you are going to point to your abdomen that I have been over here and you don't know whether there

00:46.740 --> 00:53.190
is stomach in the OR you have intestinal pain or whatever you have that is going to be decided by the

00:53.190 --> 00:53.580
doctor.

00:53.580 --> 00:58.920
So they are going to ask more questions that how are you feeling right now what is the level of the

00:58.920 --> 01:01.160
pain and things like that.

01:01.530 --> 01:03.120
So they are going to.

01:03.130 --> 01:09.050
So in this usage any map actually we are pinpointing our major pain areas.

01:09.240 --> 01:15.780
It is just like a doctor investigating a patient and seeing well actually the pain resides.

01:15.780 --> 01:24.420
So we want to see in which section of our into our whole user journey map where our customer is actually

01:25.050 --> 01:30.240
ordering something or from the point he sees our ad online.

01:30.270 --> 01:36.870
So from the time he actually become aware of our product you if you remember the awareness the model

01:36.870 --> 01:44.010
we discuss user lifecycle model and we are going to see that how actually the user took those steps

01:44.070 --> 01:47.400
and where actually they started feeling pain.

01:47.460 --> 01:51.450
Now what are actually different benefits of user journey maps.

01:51.450 --> 01:57.240
They are very obvious and I have already talked about them higher customer satisfaction or user satisfaction

01:58.290 --> 02:04.170
if we remove the pain of any person or if a doctor gives a medicine to any person.

02:04.170 --> 02:09.960
There will always be thankful they will be more satisfied with the doctor same our customers our users

02:10.330 --> 02:16.890
there will be more satisfied satisfied lower customer turnout or Joan generate is actually customers

02:16.890 --> 02:20.550
leaving after using your app for four four or five days.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.790
So we will have less turnover.

02:22.800 --> 02:29.340
We want to see that VA is the point where we are losing our customers.

02:29.340 --> 02:38.550
It is also similar somewhat similar to our user lifecycle funnel and we will have more sales if we have

02:38.550 --> 02:41.560
more customer satisfied satisfaction.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.210
We will have more sales.

02:43.230 --> 02:48.620
Similarly we will be pinpointing customer pain areas.

02:48.630 --> 02:51.020
This is actually a very wide diagram.

02:51.030 --> 02:57.360
Customer usage any map that can be applied to service industry where you are giving services to your

02:57.360 --> 02:58.130
customers.

02:58.350 --> 03:07.050
They can be they can be applied to restaurants they can be applied to hotels any schools anything.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.470
This is a very great.

03:08.640 --> 03:15.060
You can say user experience tool and design tool you can use to pinpoint where are the pins and how

03:15.060 --> 03:16.600
we are going to eliminate them.

03:16.600 --> 03:23.460
Now if we look at the example of my user Jenny map for my frock land and e-commerce store you can see

03:23.760 --> 03:29.670
the first interaction will be how my customer actually phoned my store what they what they were clicking

03:29.670 --> 03:35.240
on a Facebook ad or they found it from a friend then how she interacted with my website.

03:35.250 --> 03:41.430
What was her first interaction how happy she was when she interacted for the first time.

03:41.580 --> 03:48.270
Why did you she decide to choose the clothes how whether does she called her friend in the process or

03:48.270 --> 03:53.790
she called the help line in the process or how actually she ordered those clothes whether she was using

03:53.790 --> 04:03.270
mobile app or she was using my web app or website whether there were some delays in the delivery so

04:03.300 --> 04:10.020
you can see if you are creating a digital product there will always be some other touch points like

04:10.020 --> 04:18.360
calling the help line which is not digital it is calling people calling other people so we need to check

04:18.450 --> 04:26.820
how satisfaction satisfied all our customers at different touch points how actually they actually selected

04:26.850 --> 04:34.590
any other website why they left our website what was their frustrations what were their feelings are

04:34.590 --> 04:38.580
they happy what they left alone in the end things like that.

04:38.580 --> 04:46.950
So this is all our user journey map every user journey map have some essential parts and these are actually

04:46.950 --> 04:53.760
actions what actually users are doing it is similar to somewhat what we have covered in empathy maps

04:54.060 --> 05:01.260
Martin at that point we were more interested in what users emotions are and what they are thinking and

05:01.260 --> 05:07.590
doing so this is this is a bit different here we are actually checking where the problem resides in

05:07.590 --> 05:12.360
our whole process with an interaction with our customer.

05:12.360 --> 05:18.480
So we have motivation what is the reason behind that action what while why they were motivated to click

05:18.870 --> 05:23.760
by now and things like that then what are the frustrations what are the issues that are happening at

05:23.760 --> 05:30.210
that touchpoint point for example at checkout they might not be able to checkout using their email because

05:30.210 --> 05:39.150
they don't have any email barriers so why they are not purchasing that dress maybe the price is too

05:39.150 --> 05:46.890
high or maybe the button is disabled they don't know whether the stock is low or whatever the reason

05:46.920 --> 05:51.870
they don't know how to you know get past that then the opportunities.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.230
So opportunities us.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.860
The things we can improve.

05:56.100 --> 06:04.810
These are the areas are improvements we can make in each touchpoint or each section of our users.

06:06.120 --> 06:14.490
Now here is a customer journey map and this is my customer journey map for frog land and you can see

06:14.490 --> 06:18.780
here we have one user persona that is attached to it.

06:18.780 --> 06:25.830
So on the top of your usage any map you have to show that this persona is attached to this journey map

06:26.250 --> 06:32.820
and along with that we also want to show what actually the goals and motivations are.

06:32.820 --> 06:38.880
What is the scope of this journey map whether we are testing the whole lab we are testing the sign up

06:38.910 --> 06:46.710
we are testing the check out or we are testing some fun adding things to the card and viewing that Card

06:47.050 --> 06:50.090
card things like that so you can see here we have.

06:50.520 --> 06:57.110
The first is first impressions you can also started from maybe from the awareness of the product where

06:57.120 --> 07:03.990
they got fostered click the Facebook image or things like that you can start from there you can show

07:03.990 --> 07:11.120
your customer or your user that we have this ad and you are going to start from here.

07:11.130 --> 07:14.910
So let them start from here and give them to task what they are going to do.

07:15.120 --> 07:22.980
So you can also interview your already you know old customers are all users which are already using

07:22.980 --> 07:23.880
your app.

07:24.060 --> 07:31.710
You can ask them what their what their feelings are or frustrations are during this whole process.

07:31.710 --> 07:38.010
So touch points are first impressions searching for dresses selection process adding to cart and checkout.

07:38.010 --> 07:42.840
So this is I am actually checking first impressions to the checkout.

07:42.840 --> 07:48.170
So this is actually the whole journey of ordering customer new customer order.

07:48.180 --> 07:51.540
So actually this whole process is related to new customer order.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.700
You can see you here.

07:52.860 --> 08:00.250
I have written in our head new customer order in my scope so these are different touch points I'm showing

08:00.250 --> 08:01.780
what the user is doing.

08:01.810 --> 08:04.260
These are the actions users started taking.

08:04.270 --> 08:09.910
You can see you here and these are all the actions at the top than these are the feelings what how they

08:09.910 --> 08:17.680
are feeling really smiley face first impressions were great then they then next when they were searching

08:17.680 --> 08:22.500
they were not feeling very well selection process what not was okay.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.250
Okay.

08:23.260 --> 08:29.860
And this is very bad because they're stuck over here and they were not able to you know check out easily

08:30.870 --> 08:37.410
so here we have the opportunities here we have the frustrations that what were the problems that happened

08:37.440 --> 08:43.590
or what were the barriers that they faced during this whole process then what are the opportunities

08:43.590 --> 08:52.860
we can you know count on we can improve these things to make it more user friendly and make it user

08:52.860 --> 08:56.880
centered and we will have more satisfied customer.

08:56.940 --> 08:58.350
So this is a very simple map.

08:58.350 --> 09:04.260
I am sharing all these templates and all these files with you so you can download them and use them

09:04.290 --> 09:06.930
in your own user expense design process.

09:06.930 --> 09:08.490
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

09:08.490 --> 09:11.840
If you have any questions do ask me.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.520
Let's move on to the next lesson.
