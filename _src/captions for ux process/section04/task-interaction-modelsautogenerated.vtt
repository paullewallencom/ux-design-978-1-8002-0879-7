00:04.540 --> 00:09.650
OK now in this lesson we are going to see what is task interaction models.

00:09.760 --> 00:17.110
Now ask injection models as a name suggests that they are going to be revolving around a task and the

00:17.110 --> 00:19.960
interaction between the user and the system.

00:19.990 --> 00:26.230
So a task injection model is required to show all the interactions between your system and the user.

00:26.260 --> 00:32.650
You can define all the requirements and all the different stuff related to your user needs and things

00:32.650 --> 00:33.180
like that.

00:33.190 --> 00:38.980
But how the development team or developers are going to know how the user is going to interact and what

00:38.980 --> 00:40.570
will be the system response.

00:40.570 --> 00:49.990
For example we want to show so sure some animation or some you can see swipe effect for the users to

00:50.040 --> 00:54.520
you know get the idea of what is happening maybe we want to show some error message.

00:54.580 --> 01:00.750
So this is actually going to show all the required steps and user actions to complete a task.

01:00.760 --> 01:09.810
Now this is actually a very you can see formal interaction model you can also do what you can also do

01:09.820 --> 01:11.320
in recent years.

01:11.320 --> 01:18.280
We have seen a lot of great prototyping apps like proto by then we have principal.

01:18.290 --> 01:20.250
Then we have our Dolby actually.

01:20.440 --> 01:26.320
You can also build different task interaction models using Adobe equity.

01:26.380 --> 01:26.630
Okay.

01:26.670 --> 01:30.470
So you need to show how user is going to interact with the system what will be their use.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.170
And your system's response.

01:32.170 --> 01:39.220
You don't need to write a long stories and long documentations which which will be difficult for the

01:39.220 --> 01:41.460
developer to you know understand.

01:41.830 --> 01:48.490
You can just show them by using prototypes so you can build different prototypes for different task

01:48.490 --> 01:50.730
interactions between their user and your system.

01:50.740 --> 01:51.430
And that is all.

01:51.850 --> 01:55.540
But right now we need to see what is actually starts contraction models.

01:55.570 --> 02:04.720
Just expand your you can say knowledge frame frame of knowledge that this is actually why we are doing

02:04.720 --> 02:06.160
it now.

02:06.220 --> 02:09.670
The parts of past contraction models are the Task Name.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.320
The goal of your task.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.370
What is a trigger.

02:12.370 --> 02:13.300
What was the trigger.

02:13.300 --> 02:13.630
Why.

02:13.630 --> 02:15.680
The user started this task.

02:16.210 --> 02:23.350
What are the needs during the stocks for example a logging task needs a logging name or email address

02:23.680 --> 02:28.180
and then the password and also the barriers faced by users during the task.

02:28.180 --> 02:33.830
So what will be the barriers or what will be the problems user actually faced doing the task.

02:33.850 --> 02:42.490
So this is actually you can see a detailed task interaction model which shows that how and why user

02:42.820 --> 02:49.870
started this task and what happened doing this task and how the system responded with the messages or

02:49.870 --> 02:50.920
things like that.

02:50.950 --> 02:56.470
So let's see one example which I paid for specifically for this project from Oakland.

02:56.650 --> 03:02.650
Let me show you that now you can see this is a task interaction model for ordering us and real address.

03:02.660 --> 03:07.810
So this is the task I gave to the user and this is how actually things are going to happen on the left

03:07.810 --> 03:12.640
side is a user on the right side of the system customer search for Cinderella in the search box and

03:12.640 --> 03:13.800
click such button.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.970
You can see this is what did you do.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.990
It is showing each and every step taken by the user.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.550
This is actually very necessary.

03:21.550 --> 03:25.150
Now the next step is just clicked on the first item on such user spirit.

03:25.150 --> 03:30.010
It is also showing what is the behavior how they actually select things system return their detail page

03:30.010 --> 03:35.840
for the address customer selected customer selected pink color from the to available color options system

03:35.840 --> 03:37.540
switch the preview image to pink dress.

03:37.540 --> 03:42.700
So this is actually we are showing that this is actually how our system is going to work.

03:42.760 --> 03:49.370
Customer selected four to five years from the sizes list system highlighted the selected size and updates.

03:49.490 --> 03:53.460
Thus in stock status so right now it is in stock.

03:53.610 --> 03:57.240
Customers is a bit confused about the sizing options.

03:57.370 --> 04:02.890
So this is actually the barrier custom faced customer actually faced.

04:03.310 --> 04:08.110
And then we have customer clicked on size charts to see whether she has selected the correct side system

04:08.110 --> 04:11.230
shows the size charts on as an overlay image.

04:11.230 --> 04:17.470
Customer clicked on size chart to see whether she has selected so this is actually the user and system

04:17.500 --> 04:19.060
interacting with each other.

04:19.090 --> 04:24.030
These are the inputs what the user is doing what are the outputs denoted by the system.

04:24.130 --> 04:28.310
What are the barriers doing that which user actually faced.

04:28.390 --> 04:38.980
So this can also be your task analysis you did in your user research or it can be done on a prototype

04:38.980 --> 04:43.480
you have already developed so you had a prototype you show it to your user they used it they perform

04:43.480 --> 04:50.890
the task and this is what happened so this is all about task contraction model you can skip that you

04:50.890 --> 04:58.760
can skip that and just try to build a few prototypes because it is easier and then more visual and this

04:58.760 --> 05:02.330
shows rather than tell that is what we need.

05:02.410 --> 05:02.750
Okay.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.020
So I hope you enjoyed this task interaction model.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.160
If you have any questions to ask me.

05:08.170 --> 05:12.700
Don't forget to ask me a lot of questions because I love them.

05:12.700 --> 05:19.030
And sometimes a lot of my students that they give to Star of wonder star or three star reviews they

05:19.060 --> 05:22.310
don't happen to ask any questions to me.

05:22.420 --> 05:30.050
So this is very you can see very sad for me when the don't ask questions and they just leave one or

05:30.050 --> 05:31.270
two star reviews.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.220
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

05:33.260 --> 05:34.820
Let's move on to the next lesson.
