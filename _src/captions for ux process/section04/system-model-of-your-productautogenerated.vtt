Now the first diagram you're going to build in use it expands design process is actually system model

00:09.960 --> 00:16.640
or some may call it proposed system model that this is how our website or our app is going to work.

00:16.650 --> 00:23.680
These are the work rules all the major interesting parties that are going to use your system.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.390
Okay so that is going to be a bird's eye view.

00:27.390 --> 00:35.160
We are going to look at the overall build of our system how it is going to work and what is its major

00:35.160 --> 00:36.270
boundaries.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.350
So here we go.

00:37.350 --> 00:40.360
And let me show you what I'd actually work rules.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.440
We have already learned about work rules and personas.

00:43.590 --> 00:51.360
But here actually why I am talking about these work rules is that they are more related to your system

00:51.360 --> 00:56.430
diagram because each worker will have different jobs and different tasks.

00:56.430 --> 01:03.630
So from those work rules you are going to extract different tasks and those tasks are going to be built

01:03.630 --> 01:05.730
into your requirements of your app.

01:05.730 --> 01:12.180
So for example in my land e-commerce Web site a shopper is actually a user is a work role.

01:12.180 --> 01:18.150
Then we have an admin delivery guy company or delivery company supplier.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.880
Even as a mess or the mobile network company these are all linked.

01:24.030 --> 01:26.980
They are linked in to my system somehow.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.690
They are my work roles.

01:28.740 --> 01:33.970
So this is the thing you are going to you know look for when you are going to create your system.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.960
So let's see some example.

01:36.210 --> 01:39.620
The real example which I created this is not rocket science.

01:39.630 --> 01:45.750
It is very easy don't you know try to think that oh my god I how I am going to do that.

01:45.780 --> 01:51.750
This is very simple if you can draw some circles you can draw this system diagram on a paper.

01:51.800 --> 01:59.870
OK so let's see something example so you can see here is a system model I created using balsamic mockups

01:59.870 --> 02:04.370
you can use any software any tool even you can use paper and pencil.

02:04.550 --> 02:10.360
So the dotted line you can see it is actually the boundary of my system that these other tasks are functions

02:10.360 --> 02:18.440
it can perform the outside people that are CEO and main customer or shopper third party vendor dressmaker

02:18.470 --> 02:24.660
or delivery company they are actually my work roles and they are interacting with this system the system.

02:24.680 --> 02:30.950
This is my boundary and here we have admin that is managing product details images prices and creating

02:30.950 --> 02:38.150
deals then we have CEO says reports revenue generated in monthly sales then we have customers article

02:38.150 --> 02:46.670
frocks and dresses and keep updated about the new products filtering and with these few criteria is

02:47.640 --> 02:53.070
then we have orchestrator operated by a tracking number and azimuth receiving estimates and giving sending

02:53.070 --> 02:58.500
a semester the customer not this s Amazon order track tracking is also linked to delivery company because

02:58.500 --> 03:05.040
they are going to send these estimates then we have order dispatch with printed labels or delivery can

03:05.040 --> 03:12.180
be we are going to dispatch that to a delivery company maybe there might be someone else who is dispatching

03:12.180 --> 03:17.310
this past manager or something like that but I am not showing it over here then we have stock level

03:17.310 --> 03:24.400
alerts or maybe someone manually calling the third party vendors that we have this shortage of this

03:24.400 --> 03:30.180
dress please send us ten more pieces or 50 more pieces so stock level alerts.

03:30.180 --> 03:31.670
We also need dresses.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.710
We are not going to make them but we're going to buy them from third party.

03:35.820 --> 03:43.590
So this is actually the system model simple system model or system diagram of how my e-commerce store

03:43.590 --> 03:48.870
for frock land is going to work I hope you have enjoyed this lesson if you have any questions to ask

03:48.870 --> 03:54.030
me I am going to share all these documents and the resources so don't forget to download them and see

03:54.030 --> 03:54.840
them up close.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.460
See you soon in the next lesson.
