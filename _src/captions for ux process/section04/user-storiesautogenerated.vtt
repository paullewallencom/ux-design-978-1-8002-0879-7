In this lesson we are going to learn about user stories and in the previous lessons we have learned

00:11.870 --> 00:16.120
about user scenarios so using scenarios are the short story.

00:16.130 --> 00:22.750
Sometimes a bit long but they are mostly in a story format which shows all the soundings like a story.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.130
What is happening what was happening outside.

00:25.160 --> 00:30.130
Things like that but user stories even the name is user story.

00:30.140 --> 00:35.860
They are very short one line sentence and they are going to show the user requirements.

00:35.950 --> 00:37.430
Okay so they are coming from.

00:37.430 --> 00:44.300
They will be written in a format which is from users perspective that this is the need of the user.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.440
And this is how they are going to interact with the system.

00:47.630 --> 00:54.560
And this is the benefit they will get from this interaction so juicy stories are attached to personas.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.320
Are your users or VLC rules.

00:57.470 --> 01:04.580
So it is actually you can say requirements gathering for all your work roles and personas.

01:04.590 --> 01:09.360
Now let's see how we are going to write a user story so the user story format.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.830
It is very simple very straightforward.

01:12.030 --> 01:18.720
As a user and at the place of the user you can use a Volcker rule like in my case it could be administrator

01:18.770 --> 01:19.760
of my site.

01:19.920 --> 01:27.180
It could be C or who is willing to see the reports sales reports and then their need.

01:27.210 --> 01:30.920
I want to have this or I have on to have this feature.

01:31.050 --> 01:36.360
I want to be able to do this so that I can get this benefit.

01:36.370 --> 01:39.090
So why actually do they need this feature.

01:39.090 --> 01:43.950
So we also want to have both the need and its benefit.

01:43.950 --> 01:51.300
What actually is they are going to get from it so you can see in my frog land example you can see it's

01:52.120 --> 01:58.800
a busy mom busy dad or college dean they are actually the users or personas and benefit is of a value

01:58.830 --> 02:06.690
they are going to get out of using my system or my product like saving time like maybe ordering before

02:06.690 --> 02:14.690
the summer or automate my workflow automate my things things like that now here are a few user stories

02:14.780 --> 02:19.290
from my fraud land startup and you can see we're here as an administrator.

02:19.400 --> 02:26.330
I want to create edit and delete products easily so I can save time and manage my products so we can

02:26.390 --> 02:31.690
also separate them in each sentence like create products added products DEET products.

02:31.700 --> 02:36.760
Or we can mix them all into one use a story that is up to you.

02:36.950 --> 02:43.340
Then we have a busy mom so you can see the need of a busy mom is I want to order using WhatsApp number

02:44.090 --> 02:47.200
only so I can feel safe and order without e-mail.

02:47.240 --> 02:53.960
So actually the what is the benefit they have aren't they actually their problem is they want to feel

02:53.960 --> 02:55.980
safe and order without an email.

02:56.270 --> 02:59.150
So it could not be always a WhatsApp number.

02:59.150 --> 03:05.270
This is up to us to decide in the design process our implementation process that how we can make our

03:05.270 --> 03:10.210
website secure and we can let our users order without email.

03:10.280 --> 03:16.240
Maybe they can log in using a phone number or mobile number.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.840
So this is open.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.650
Okay.

03:18.980 --> 03:24.530
Then we have the third which is another college girl or teen girl which was another our archetype in

03:24.530 --> 03:28.160
our personas as a college girl or teenage girl.

03:28.160 --> 03:33.890
I want to get my package within two days so the package dies before my sister's birthday.

03:33.890 --> 03:37.400
So this is actually a user need that they want to track their package.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.080
They want to see when it is going to be delivered.

03:41.300 --> 03:47.560
Will it be in the morning or will they be receiving it in the noon afternoon or whatever.

03:47.870 --> 03:52.160
So this is actually another user need and their benefit.

03:52.160 --> 03:56.960
They are going to get from them attached to user personas so this is all about user stories.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.630
They are very simple very easy.

03:58.910 --> 04:06.490
Now why do we write user stories so actually we write them so we can get what will be the cost.

04:06.500 --> 04:11.550
So actually in from these whole user stories we are going to get that requirement.

04:11.570 --> 04:20.210
So these are the features we want to build in our product to compensate or to fulfill these user needs

04:20.270 --> 04:23.060
and these user satisfactions.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.090
So we have the list.

04:24.110 --> 04:31.490
Now we have all the list of all the features or functions users and our vulnerable wants and why actually

04:31.490 --> 04:38.300
divorced it so we can easily estimate no costs and development times what are or what are the features

04:38.300 --> 04:40.210
we actually want to build.

04:40.220 --> 04:46.760
What are the features we can't build because of the cost limitations or development time limitation.

04:47.060 --> 04:53.720
We can also discuss with our stakeholders different stakeholders EU and other people that these are

04:53.720 --> 04:57.020
the things we cannot fulfill or these other user stories.

04:57.020 --> 04:59.590
We cannot sort out right now.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.370
Maybe in the next please we can fulfill them.

05:03.410 --> 05:04.910
So this is all about user stories.

05:04.910 --> 05:11.600
I am going to give you templates and an exercise to create some user stories so let's move on to the

05:11.600 --> 05:12.140
next lesson.
