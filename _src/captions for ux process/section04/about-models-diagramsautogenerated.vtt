Whenever we are designing something or planning something even we are building a new house.

00:10.350 --> 00:17.970
We actually draw some diagrams and models of that house and explain and how all the rooms will be planned.

00:17.970 --> 00:24.420
Then once that room has been planned we go into details what we will be play if we will be placing in

00:24.420 --> 00:28.220
each room we will be blessing so forward here.

00:28.590 --> 00:32.990
That tap will be over here and the TV station will be over here.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.170
Things like that.

00:34.170 --> 00:40.680
So in user expense design similarly we have two types of model simple models where we are going to view

00:40.680 --> 00:44.170
from a bird's eye view and they are not very detailed.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.720
Then we have detailed models.

00:45.750 --> 00:51.000
So in this lesson we are going to see some of the diagrams or models we are going to look at during

00:51.000 --> 00:51.690
our process.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.350
So let's go ahead now.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.590
There are simple models that use Express design.

00:55.590 --> 01:01.710
Few are like system models how your whole system is going to work then user journey maps what are different

01:01.710 --> 01:06.780
touch points where our users are actually connecting with our product.

01:06.810 --> 01:13.560
User stories there will be long stories a visual story of your user using your whole product or there

01:13.560 --> 01:21.180
will be short single line stories about the usage of your app now then we are going to move into more

01:21.180 --> 01:28.680
detailed models like user scenarios where we have very long scenarios are users using your app in his

01:28.680 --> 01:30.760
room or things like that.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.710
Then we have task interaction models.

01:33.720 --> 01:40.980
So there will be tasks our users will be performing dogs tasks and we are going to show all the interactions

01:41.010 --> 01:42.520
during that task.

01:42.660 --> 01:48.210
So there could be like ten different tasks on maybe 20 different tasks a user can do.

01:48.390 --> 01:55.710
So we have to make each task the model for each task so it is in more detail than we have use case diagrams

01:55.710 --> 02:01.920
how our users are actually going to interact with the system and how the system is going to reply back

02:01.950 --> 02:02.950
and things like that.

02:02.990 --> 02:08.130
Now along this whole journey of creating user expense diagram and models there are two things you need

02:08.130 --> 02:09.090
to keep in mind.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.210
One thing is feature roadmap.

02:11.250 --> 02:16.740
We already decided that we are not going to develop these features or we might develop these features

02:16.740 --> 02:18.040
in the next six months.

02:18.630 --> 02:22.890
So you need to create a roadmap diagram of your product.

02:22.890 --> 02:27.990
So in the first three months we are going to launch these three essential features.

02:27.990 --> 02:35.990
Then in the next one we are going to launch these four features and similarly move on to the next.

02:36.030 --> 02:43.530
It will be based on what we did in feature matrix which features unnecessary and essential for your

02:43.530 --> 02:44.650
users.

02:44.670 --> 02:49.550
So design principles and guidelines is a bit different story.

02:49.550 --> 02:55.320
It is actually the boundary of your design and the direction of your design.

02:55.350 --> 03:04.270
You want your app to be conservative or you want your app to be used by just professionals or you wanted

03:04.290 --> 03:09.330
to be invited by other designers and white only app things like that.

03:09.330 --> 03:15.750
There must be some principles that are going to guide your design that we want it to be intuitive and

03:15.750 --> 03:19.650
we want it to be inviting and things like that.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.820
They are not really related to what features that you are going to develop but they are actually the

03:23.820 --> 03:27.240
guides that in which direction that design will go.

03:27.250 --> 03:32.040
Now let us start with our first model which is system model in the next lesson.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.480
Let's move on to the next lesson.
