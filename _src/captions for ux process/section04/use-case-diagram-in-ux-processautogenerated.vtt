00:04.560 --> 00:09.490
Now in the previous few lessons we were talking about user scenarios user stories.

00:09.530 --> 00:10.820
What are the user needs.

00:10.820 --> 00:15.170
What the what is the context they have used and they are while.

00:15.220 --> 00:20.930
Were using our product or our e-commerce store or anything and mobile app.

00:21.140 --> 00:27.440
Now is the time we are going into the interaction how the interaction between the user and the system

00:27.650 --> 00:29.010
is going to happen.

00:29.030 --> 00:32.860
What will be the actions what will be the events that are going to trigger them.

00:32.870 --> 00:34.400
What will be the system behavior.

00:34.430 --> 00:40.410
So this is actually basically a software requirement gathering tool use guest diagram.

00:40.410 --> 00:48.230
And when I was in college I used to love creating them and at that time it was related to databases

00:48.230 --> 00:49.090
and things like that.

00:49.100 --> 00:56.300
But right now we use them in a simpler way in user expense design now in any Use Case Diagram.

00:56.300 --> 00:59.920
There are two things in case of my fraud plan.

00:59.920 --> 01:06.650
You can see we have actors that are going to you know be action performers because it is about action

01:06.680 --> 01:10.840
and reaction of the system or action of the user and reaction of the system.

01:10.850 --> 01:13.640
So action is going to be a to actor.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.910
So actors could be our customer or our shopper.

01:16.940 --> 01:23.340
Then our delivery department website administration help line girl or helpline guy whoever they have

01:23.350 --> 01:26.270
they are stock but she is a manager.

01:26.360 --> 01:32.700
It could be third party managers stock management party or things like that.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.140
Then we have the events or actions.

01:35.180 --> 01:40.690
So this is actually the whole Use Case Diagram relation.

01:40.730 --> 01:47.300
So if we are showing a Use Case Diagram of logging then it will only cover the logging interaction between

01:47.300 --> 01:49.280
the actor and the system.

01:49.310 --> 01:56.150
If we are looking at checkout process for a new user then it will be just the checkout process.

01:56.180 --> 02:02.400
The whole process and how the act of what are different things.

02:02.420 --> 02:03.650
A user can do.

02:03.650 --> 02:05.780
What are the different functions.

02:05.780 --> 02:11.690
A user can perform on your system and what will be the system doing after they click or perform that

02:12.020 --> 02:13.170
action.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.650
Then it could be also calling the help line.

02:15.770 --> 02:21.020
So I'm going to show you and share with you my example of Use Case Diagram.

02:21.020 --> 02:25.280
I build for one process or action or event.

02:25.280 --> 02:33.720
So let's see that now you can see this is a simple Use Case Diagram for Busy Moms ordering using WhatsApp

02:34.020 --> 02:39.000
so you can see we want to be very specific what is actually the action or the process which is happening

02:39.000 --> 02:44.430
and the whole Use Case Diagram is about.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.380
So this is very very important.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.020
So you can see on the left side we have users on the right side.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.630
We have another actor on the left.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.570
We have busy mom.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.720
This is an actor.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.720
Let's zoom in a little bit.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.140
Okay.

02:57.160 --> 03:04.330
So we have busy mom actor on the left then and the process all the functions they can perform within

03:04.330 --> 03:09.970
the system you can see this dotted line all around is a system boundary you can see here I have written

03:09.970 --> 03:14.230
system boundary and this is actually what she can do.

03:14.260 --> 03:19.990
She is going to view deals or browse products then she will add to the cards so they are in a sequence

03:19.990 --> 03:27.300
from top to bottom you can see then we have checkout with WhatsApp calls or send messages via WhatsApp.

03:27.310 --> 03:32.860
So she is actually messaging and this message will be received by this help line guy.

03:32.860 --> 03:39.210
You can see how he's also act and you can see interacting with the same process.

03:39.340 --> 03:46.270
So she after she messages he is going to ask for dress product ideas what are the product ideas related

03:46.270 --> 03:50.580
to your the dresses in your card okay so next.

03:50.580 --> 03:58.020
This guy is actually going to create an order audio or update stalk with whatever she has chosen because

03:58.020 --> 04:02.320
she is not using this system to order.

04:02.340 --> 04:05.640
She has just a field card and she is not checking out.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.060
So all the stocks will be the same.

04:08.100 --> 04:08.910
They will not affect.

04:08.910 --> 04:15.930
So he has to create some dummy account or things like that to create a record of that in that order

04:16.290 --> 04:22.360
and generate an order i.e. OK so you can see here is his processes.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.790
Now this is only related to this actor.

04:24.790 --> 04:27.980
So it has nothing to do with our busy mom.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.520
So then you can see at the end Senate order no amount estimated delivery time.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.310
These three things he is going to send the order confirmation.

04:36.350 --> 04:42.570
S M S on mobile after he will generate that order as Smith will be automatically generated.

04:42.580 --> 04:46.630
And here you can see she receives as a mess on the mobile.

04:46.660 --> 04:49.030
This is going back to busy mom.

04:49.030 --> 04:50.500
So this is our system boundary.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.280
This is very simple Use Case Diagram.

04:53.410 --> 04:59.050
It actually shows what is the interaction of the system and how the user is actually going to interact

04:59.050 --> 05:05.320
with the system what functions they can use how and which sequence they are going to use it.

05:05.320 --> 05:10.540
What will be the inputs and outputs like you can see what will be the asked and what she will be sending

05:10.540 --> 05:11.340
into the system.

05:11.350 --> 05:22.170
What he will be asking for the system or the user to send these things Okay so these are this is very

05:22.170 --> 05:25.020
simple very simple use guest diagram.

05:25.050 --> 05:31.980
You can find a lot of different examples online but this is actually what we will be using simply in

05:31.980 --> 05:34.310
our user expense diagram.

05:34.420 --> 05:42.300
The you use case diagram which we use in software development with databases and things like that.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.900
That is a bit different but this one is what you can use.

05:46.900 --> 05:50.840
Okay so I'm giving you all these into a PDA format.

05:50.840 --> 05:56.050
Don't forget to download it and see and try to build upon it.

05:56.070 --> 05:57.630
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

05:57.630 --> 05:59.210
Let's move on to the next lesson.
