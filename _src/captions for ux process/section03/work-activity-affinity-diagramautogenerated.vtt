00:04.370 --> 00:10.980
In this lesson we are going to talk about work activity affinity diagram or simply call affinity diagram.

00:10.980 --> 00:17.370
Now you might have seen a lot of user expense designers pasting different sticky notes on their walls

00:17.380 --> 00:18.190
are there.

00:18.270 --> 00:20.590
They are filled with different sticky notes.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.540
These is actually what they are doing.

00:23.610 --> 00:25.500
They are making an affinity diagram.

00:26.220 --> 00:32.460
So actually why do we use this technique or why do we use affinity diagram.

00:32.460 --> 00:40.650
Because when we interview our users and our stakeholders we have different data collected that is in

00:40.650 --> 00:43.510
a raw format that doesn't make sense.

00:43.530 --> 00:49.720
So we are going to create different sticky notes and we are going to write what we found out.

00:49.800 --> 00:55.380
For example the features user have or things like that and we're going to sort them out into different

00:55.740 --> 00:56.710
sections.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.790
So we are going to make different connections between them.

00:59.790 --> 01:06.880
Common themes that these things are related to sign up or these things are legit to check out.

01:06.900 --> 01:14.790
So we are going to use sticky notes and grouped them to show what we can improve and then we are going

01:14.790 --> 01:20.450
to map out our whole data intersections okay.

01:20.450 --> 01:28.040
Now the steps to create w w e d red or Volk affinity diagram.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.400
Affinity diagram.

01:29.430 --> 01:35.060
So first thing you are going to do is write your findings on sticky notes that is obvious.

01:35.060 --> 01:44.120
So write them into short sentences or maybe three or four words or five words or six words and you are

01:44.120 --> 01:50.080
going to paste them on a whiteboard and you are going to start creating groups.

01:50.150 --> 01:58.100
So for example I found that I have like 10 sticky notes that are going to belong to log in screen or

01:58.100 --> 02:01.070
log in options I'm going to paste them over there.

02:01.430 --> 02:09.330
So don't worry if you find something else later on you can move that sticky note to another section.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.730
So we are going to build some common themes between them.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.370
We are going to create groups and even subgroups that this is going to be logging.

02:18.380 --> 02:21.200
And this is going to be into social logging.

02:21.200 --> 02:28.740
So these social logging is actually a subgroup in the logging section similarly we are at the end.

02:28.770 --> 02:36.600
We are going to give points and trading to most important ideas for example a user might say that I

02:36.600 --> 02:44.210
want to have an e-commerce website that can deliver me products within one hour.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.840
So it is often almost impossible right now.

02:47.880 --> 02:55.300
So we are not going to you know give attention to these kind of user requests or user findings.

02:55.350 --> 02:57.660
We are going to give them zero points.

02:57.660 --> 03:04.200
So the most important ones which you really think that they are going to solve is users problem.

03:04.200 --> 03:08.940
We are going to give them points so these points are given by your whole team.

03:08.940 --> 03:14.450
There might be CEO in your team there might be marketing managers there might be developers.

03:14.640 --> 03:21.180
There might be a designers of all the people who have interviewed the users.

03:21.300 --> 03:27.930
So once you have gone into the user interview try to bring your team members like your developers and

03:27.930 --> 03:34.950
your managers or CEOs of your product so they can also see what are the pain points of your users.

03:34.950 --> 03:40.950
So in this giving points and ratings for most important ideas will be depending on the user interview

03:41.010 --> 03:47.490
team you got when you interviewed the users because the people who haven't seen the users actually in

03:47.550 --> 03:53.390
being they are not going to you know pay attention to the real pain points.

03:53.430 --> 04:01.320
So this is how you are going to arrange your group your ideas I am going to show you my w 80 diagram.

04:01.410 --> 04:08.010
Now I'm going to show you my work of activity affinity diagram from my far my far from land project

04:08.550 --> 04:10.670
so you can see there.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.280
These are different groups.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.400
Top is actually yellow.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.530
You can use different colors.

04:15.540 --> 04:23.220
You can use sticky n but I have use something else I'm using balsamic mockups to create this so you

04:23.220 --> 04:30.330
can see we have different sections we interviewed for logging create new account security concerns buying

04:30.330 --> 04:38.040
decisions product information pricing ideas ordering and returns order checkout returning items menus

04:38.040 --> 04:38.730
and navigation.

04:38.730 --> 04:47.190
So this is actually this data is based on just two users so you can see how much Ted how we can get

04:47.190 --> 04:52.470
if we interview three to five users there will be tons of different sticky notes right now you can see

04:53.040 --> 05:02.790
I have a like I think I have around like Help Line landing page search bar menus or navigation.

05:02.790 --> 05:10.980
So I have like 10 to 12 categories and then I have like five to six sticky notes into each category.

05:10.980 --> 05:17.220
So this is like hundred of sticky n for just two users so you can see how much data you can collect.

05:17.220 --> 05:26.500
So from this data you can see we have things like I like for example you can see if we have this log

05:26.500 --> 05:37.230
in what actually happened is my user actually had no email address or she doesn't remember email address

05:37.620 --> 05:44.610
for a lot of university students in our country most of them don't use email regularly they have Facebook

05:44.610 --> 05:49.610
accounts they have phone numbers but they don't use e-mails.

05:49.770 --> 05:57.390
So once they go to the logon screen there was you know a reluctant to you know even log in or sign up

05:57.450 --> 06:05.970
with an email so you can see here are a few things I found during user interview user don't understand

06:05.970 --> 06:07.230
words sign up.

06:07.230 --> 06:11.220
So this is very very specific to our area.

06:11.670 --> 06:21.270
So in Asia or in Pakistan or India users might be able to you know get more information or easier it

06:21.270 --> 06:26.280
is it will be easier for them to create account if we have read and create new accounts rather than

06:26.280 --> 06:30.190
sign up because sign and sign up they don't understand the difference.

06:30.300 --> 06:37.320
Most of them create new account use should be used for sign up and this is a suggestion help video or

06:37.350 --> 06:44.040
help line would be visible because actually my user one of my user actually tried to you know contact

06:44.040 --> 06:49.050
with the help line to help her create new account.

06:49.050 --> 06:55.560
So this is you know these are the things I noted down then we have security concerns I asked few questions

06:55.560 --> 07:03.540
about 30 security concerns and they wanted to have a password I thought that in my assumptions I thought

07:03.540 --> 07:10.140
that password is not necessary they might log in just with their phone numbers but they said that we

07:10.140 --> 07:20.830
want a password for security reasons then the trust issues were that they want to have some thing like

07:21.250 --> 07:26.010
24/7 help line and things like return policy Shawn.

07:26.560 --> 07:32.470
So these are the things that should be visible product information you can see product title available

07:32.470 --> 07:38.470
stock options to select color size fabric images and description and reviews.

07:38.470 --> 07:44.670
So these are the things we need in our product or these are the things that make them buy this.

07:44.680 --> 07:52.240
So I also got some pricing ideas that what I showed some frog images the different dresses of little

07:52.240 --> 07:58.070
girls and showed them that what could be the price of these frocks.

07:58.210 --> 08:03.790
So will you be able to pay how much you would pay to buy this kind of from.

08:04.150 --> 08:12.190
So they were around 20 dollars to thirty five dollars so it is like they are eager to be in my Pakistani

08:12.190 --> 08:12.610
currency.

08:12.610 --> 08:18.250
They were eager to pay like 3000 to 5000 rupees.

08:18.250 --> 08:24.850
And when I asked them for the budget they said I my budget is a maximum to the thousand.

08:25.210 --> 08:34.260
So you should you should also ask them what is the budget OK so for example a college girl they might

08:34.260 --> 08:41.190
not have a budget of like 30 dollars they might want to buy something and you know within their range

08:41.880 --> 08:44.100
then we have our check out.

08:44.130 --> 08:51.660
This is we need to figure out we have to you know investigate more users for the checkout process.

08:51.690 --> 08:57.230
Stunning item you can see she had a lot of bad experience earlier with other Web sites.

08:57.250 --> 09:01.170
Here we can improve our Web site menus and navigation.

09:01.170 --> 09:06.360
I asked them to you know show me different dresses.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.740
I brought these.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.410
Actually I did a card sorting exercise.

09:10.410 --> 09:17.300
I write some of the terms like fancy dress princess dress but before casual or cotton frocks.

09:17.520 --> 09:27.270
So actually Barbie frock was found in the users had they were they were not recognizing princess dress

09:27.270 --> 09:32.010
actually diva using term Barbie frog to search for princess dress.

09:32.010 --> 09:34.160
So that is why I have listed over here.

09:34.770 --> 09:37.910
User didn't recognize hamburger menu.

09:37.980 --> 09:45.330
You can see this is very alarming for me because most of the designers like me they think that user

09:45.750 --> 09:53.910
can easily you know recognize hamburger menu use it also keep on calling my navigation navigation board

09:53.970 --> 09:54.870
options.

09:54.900 --> 10:04.800
So this is you know it was very strange for me and in the search bar user tried to use color keywords

10:04.800 --> 10:08.180
like Red Frog or white dress or things like that.

10:08.310 --> 10:10.280
They also search for bullfrogs.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.550
So these are the things we are going to use for in our product.

10:14.550 --> 10:20.790
For example if I'm listing my products I'm going to use tags to enlist my products.

10:20.820 --> 10:25.480
And these tags will represent or it will make the users much easier.

10:25.650 --> 10:31.050
Like I never thought that there would be Barbie frocks or Barbie dresses.

10:31.260 --> 10:34.440
I just thought that there would be just princess dresses.

10:34.650 --> 10:42.300
Also on a landing page or our main page user always look for discounted or sale items so they were looking

10:42.300 --> 10:46.400
for sale keyword on the whole page and they didn't find it.

10:46.410 --> 10:55.350
And you know they thought that they would first go to the sale page or discounted discounts page rather

10:55.350 --> 10:59.200
than going to explore other areas.

10:59.460 --> 11:08.280
So you can see this is actually real data from my user interview and you can see how much data we can

11:08.280 --> 11:11.040
collect if we just interview three to five users.

11:11.040 --> 11:17.390
I have just interviewed one or two users and you can see this is the data so I hope you have enjoyed

11:17.390 --> 11:23.390
this lesson about how I created my work of activity affinity diagram.

11:23.630 --> 11:30.290
And from this diagram we are going to create more diagrams and more features and things more specifications

11:30.290 --> 11:31.620
for our product.

11:31.760 --> 11:38.520
Let's move on to the next lesson and you can download this affinity diagram from our resources section

11:38.540 --> 11:41.410
and from this lesson I hope you enjoyed this lesson.

11:41.420 --> 11:42.970
Let's move on to the next lesson.
