00:04.690 --> 00:11.080
Now the first step in your user expense design process should be stakeholders interviews so why the

00:11.080 --> 00:15.930
CEO or the product manager or the product owner.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.990
Why in the first place they created this product.

00:19.990 --> 00:22.630
What make them create this product.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.720
Why are they doing it.

00:24.730 --> 00:30.440
What makes them think that this product is going to solve this user problem.

00:30.490 --> 00:37.570
So a lot of times the product owners or the product managers are the people like developers or maybe

00:37.570 --> 00:40.320
they are marketers or things like that.

00:40.360 --> 00:45.660
So we need to understand why they are creating this product.

00:45.700 --> 00:52.630
This app this e-commerce Web site or whatever they are building now when it was you were going for a

00:52.630 --> 00:53.830
stakeholder interviews.

00:53.830 --> 00:58.750
There are two most essential things you are going to ask them.

00:58.750 --> 01:03.430
The first is what is the primary goal of your product.

01:03.430 --> 01:10.280
So goals are really important from stakeholders point of view or whether you are interviewing users.

01:10.330 --> 01:14.070
The first thing you are going to ask is What is your primary goal.

01:14.080 --> 01:20.230
So this is going to be a long term goal and short term goals so long term goals might be that I want

01:20.230 --> 01:22.480
to within five years.

01:22.720 --> 01:31.330
I want my users to have these many features or they can drive this car without any interaction from

01:31.330 --> 01:39.370
the outside world or this car is going to stop on any billboard that is you know connected with their

01:39.640 --> 01:41.560
app or things like that.

01:41.620 --> 01:46.840
So there are many things we are going to have on the long term list.

01:46.960 --> 01:55.110
So at least ask them t to five short term goals and long term goals then the other thing is emotional

01:55.110 --> 01:55.560
side.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.460
What emotions they have about their product.

01:59.700 --> 02:07.160
So let them write a short story about their product to get the emotions in their soul or in their heart

02:07.170 --> 02:15.030
that my product is actually for busy photographers when they go out in the void and they are going to

02:15.030 --> 02:16.450
drop their camera.

02:16.560 --> 02:24.120
And this happened with me and my wife and we were you know in a lot of pain and we don't know what to

02:24.120 --> 02:24.660
do.

02:24.690 --> 02:25.640
So things like that.

02:25.630 --> 02:34.260
So we need to get the emotional part along with all the goals and what are their plans for their product.

02:34.260 --> 02:35.490
So this is going to help.

02:35.490 --> 02:37.440
These are the questions you are going to ask.

02:37.800 --> 02:44.260
I'm going to give you a resource a list of questions you are going to ask and you can download them.

02:44.340 --> 02:46.940
So don't worry and you don't need to remember them.

02:47.010 --> 02:53.190
So you have already asked few questions primary goals and emotional feelings and stories about that

02:53.190 --> 02:53.640
product.

02:53.640 --> 03:00.090
Now is the time that you want to book into the fears and assumptions of your stakeholders.

03:00.090 --> 03:06.300
They might be thinking something that is not a you know actually going to happen or what fears they

03:06.300 --> 03:13.770
have about their product that if the user is not going to use my cloud features then I am going to lose

03:13.770 --> 03:15.240
my business.

03:15.360 --> 03:21.820
Will the people actually be 100 bugs for this feature or whether they.

03:21.810 --> 03:29.850
I'm going to get more subscriptions that are going to you know withstand the cost of my app or a lot

03:29.850 --> 03:31.840
of different things they can do.

03:31.890 --> 03:34.050
These can come up with in their mind.

03:34.050 --> 03:38.710
So you are going to ask questions about the fears or assumptions.

03:38.940 --> 03:42.740
For example a simple question would be what do you think that.

03:43.050 --> 03:49.860
What are the things that you fear more stage your product is going to fail if something happens like

03:49.860 --> 03:50.500
this.

03:50.520 --> 03:56.250
So tell me three things or four things or five things that can make your product fail.

03:56.760 --> 04:04.700
So this is going to you know a very big thing because we need to avoid it in every step.

04:04.740 --> 04:12.630
And also if you know about design sprints and agent user expense design where we actually use a very

04:12.630 --> 04:19.140
swift use expense design process we actually use these fears and assumptions and we test one of them

04:19.140 --> 04:20.490
which is most important.

04:20.640 --> 04:24.860
And if it proves wrong then we are going to build a product.

04:24.870 --> 04:29.540
So this is how we are going to ask about the fears and assumptions of other users.

04:29.570 --> 04:33.210
The last thing we are going to ask our stakeholders is about the users.

04:33.420 --> 04:36.000
So for whom you are building this product.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.240
Tell me who will use this product.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.010
Where they will use this product.

04:40.050 --> 04:46.560
What do you want those users to feel about your product what brand you are promoting what are your brand

04:46.560 --> 04:47.520
values.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.630
What are your design principles things like that.

04:50.640 --> 04:58.560
These are actually you can say you can see aesthetics and actually as tactical aspects for example brand

04:58.560 --> 04:59.880
guidelines or things like that.

04:59.880 --> 05:08.160
Also about the users what they have in their mind that the ideal user will be something a busy mom or

05:08.160 --> 05:10.400
a busy dad or things like that.

05:10.410 --> 05:17.610
So these are few questions you are going to ask before you get into any user expense design process.

05:17.610 --> 05:23.940
So I am going to share with you a whole document where I have asked a lot of different questions from

05:23.940 --> 05:31.110
our stakeholders and in this whole course we are actually building an e-commerce store for a specific

05:31.110 --> 05:35.070
niche which is princess dresses.

05:35.070 --> 05:43.200
So we are actually aiming at the users which are from our end user will be the girls from three years

05:43.530 --> 05:45.570
to ten or twelve years.

05:45.630 --> 05:50.330
So why I took this example because it is easier to explain and comprehend.

05:50.340 --> 05:57.210
No go ahead and download the sample questions along with this lesson I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.700
Let's move on to the next lesson.
