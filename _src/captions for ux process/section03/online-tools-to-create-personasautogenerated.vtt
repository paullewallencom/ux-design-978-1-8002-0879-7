00:04.320 --> 00:09.600
In this video I'm going to show you and tell you two different tools which have free version available

00:09.990 --> 00:14.310
and you can sign up for free and use and create personas online.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.540
OK so first rule is essential you can see over here.

00:17.540 --> 00:24.060
I have already signed up so if I go to my screen you can see I have this template built in which you

00:24.060 --> 00:25.350
can use for your persona.

00:25.380 --> 00:32.640
So if I go back to my main dashboard you can see I have this all folios and I have this proc line in

00:32.640 --> 00:33.110
it.

00:33.330 --> 00:39.780
And then if I try to click edit folio you can see it is going to show me this over here.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.160
OK so I can type the name of my personas maybe

00:47.220 --> 00:50.360
I mean the Oz or something like that.

00:50.380 --> 00:57.450
OK then you can use any photo of a female then on the left we have a quotation that captures the person's

00:57.450 --> 00:58.220
personality.

00:58.320 --> 01:05.520
So this condition will be related to your product or how their behavior is online or maybe with e-commerce

01:05.520 --> 01:06.780
websites.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.660
This is not their life.

01:08.860 --> 01:14.460
Life's personality or their lives quotation that I want to live happily after my 50s or things like

01:14.460 --> 01:14.700
that.

01:14.700 --> 01:23.380
So you need to avoid that then we have some demographics like what is the age work family and location

01:23.380 --> 01:24.280
character type.

01:25.120 --> 01:30.790
Then we have this personality personality Bob's introvert extrovert analytical creative conservative

01:30.790 --> 01:32.970
liberal active or passive.

01:33.010 --> 01:39.880
So this is actually telling us that how our users are going to behave whether they're you know going

01:39.880 --> 01:45.520
to a lot of people meet others they are very creative or they're very analytical.

01:45.520 --> 01:54.070
What kind of thinking pattern they have so the main thing over here is these ghouls frustrations.

01:54.270 --> 02:00.000
These are very important so these goals are actually allergic to how they use your product or similar

02:00.000 --> 02:06.870
products how they actually you know they have their goals in mind what are they planning for so when

02:06.870 --> 02:13.350
they open a website or open an e-commerce store what are they thinking what are their goals then we

02:13.350 --> 02:16.320
have the frustrations of what are the things they like to avoid.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.760
What are their fears.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.470
What are their pain points.

02:19.470 --> 02:26.010
So there are different words for this frustration whether it's pain point or sometimes that effort as

02:26.460 --> 02:28.050
fears or things like that.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.380
So these are the things we are going to list all in here.

02:31.380 --> 02:40.260
This is a chart by a graph biography of describing your user what they do what they live for and how

02:40.260 --> 02:41.620
they spend their whole day.

02:41.650 --> 02:43.480
So this is also very important.

02:43.710 --> 02:47.490
On the top we have traits which are like busy punctual.

02:47.490 --> 02:52.170
These are actually defining the personality what kind of personality they have.

02:52.560 --> 03:02.340
Maybe they are very busy businesswomen maybe punctual or regular or things like that on the right.

03:02.340 --> 03:11.880
We have motivations of what motivates them to pursue their goals or you can say pursue their daily goals

03:11.880 --> 03:12.930
or things like that.

03:12.990 --> 03:20.100
So whether it's incentive if they have given some incentive or whether it's fear that is motivating

03:20.100 --> 03:27.730
them that I don't want to lose the trust of my kids or things like that so they might have fear to put

03:27.830 --> 03:35.990
the frocks or their kids dress they might feel some achievement that I would be a great mom if I.

03:36.050 --> 03:41.020
She has these frocks for my these great looking dresses from for my kids.

03:41.190 --> 03:49.020
Then they might have some growth possibilities like I want to you know be better at my job and more

03:49.020 --> 03:55.950
to grow because I don't want to waste time and I want it to be you know I do it quickly and easily so

03:55.950 --> 03:59.850
I don't you know feel frustrated when I go to jobs.

04:00.090 --> 04:01.230
My daily job.

04:01.350 --> 04:04.650
And then it might be power than it might be social behavior.

04:04.650 --> 04:09.750
I want my I want I want my kids to look better than there are scared.

04:09.830 --> 04:12.180
There aren't these kids or things like that.

04:12.180 --> 04:15.220
She might be comparing her kids with other kids.

04:15.390 --> 04:18.660
So this is actually motivation and social behavior.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.010
Then we have brands.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.530
So what kind of different brands they love.

04:22.530 --> 04:29.450
This is going to tell us what their tastes are how they like different brands and why do they love them.

04:30.180 --> 04:36.240
So this is a few images over here for different brands they love then the preferred channels.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.420
What are the preferred channels they normally use.

04:39.420 --> 04:46.360
Because we are actually going to ultimately advertise and market our product first.

04:46.380 --> 04:51.750
So we need to know what are the ads they are looking for whether they read traditional ads newspapers

04:52.560 --> 04:58.070
or they use online services or social media whether they use Instagram spend their time on Instagram

04:58.080 --> 05:02.730
Facebook or what other groups they are regularly checking.

05:02.730 --> 05:08.130
So these are the things we are going to look for then whether they get some reference from their friends

05:08.520 --> 05:10.170
or what are different you know.

05:10.290 --> 05:17.670
So these are different preferred channels so the whole layout or the things are actually similar.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.200
If I go to extend you as you express here this is another tool.

05:21.210 --> 05:28.420
This is actually the one I created and it is called Busy moms you can see this is their archetype type

05:28.440 --> 05:30.740
or main type of the use of busy moms.

05:30.810 --> 05:36.520
This is the name market size that this user is almost 30 percent off my personas.

05:36.540 --> 05:42.780
Then on the left I have demographics female thirty five this is the location married what would they

05:42.780 --> 05:43.110
do.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.210
What is the income per month.

05:45.210 --> 05:47.950
If you want to add more fields you can add a hair.

05:48.070 --> 05:53.880
Then I also really need to see the skills they have because they are going to order online using my

05:53.880 --> 05:54.870
e-commerce store.

05:55.020 --> 05:59.930
So they have some computer skills so I am going to go with these kids dad home.

05:59.940 --> 06:04.750
How many times they have ordered online whether they have ordered online before or not.

06:04.800 --> 06:10.710
So the this is actually comfortable e-commerce store orders using mobile phones I want to check that

06:11.040 --> 06:15.730
whether they have already all used their mobile phones to order online or not.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.800
Then we have technologies they use.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.850
So this is actually Android.

06:19.860 --> 06:28.260
They are using Android then they are using windows in my country Macs and apples are very rare so very

06:28.260 --> 06:29.780
few people use them.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.920
Then we we need to know what browsers they are using they are using Internet Explorer.

06:33.930 --> 06:41.070
They are using this chrome browser which browser type because we need to adjust our websites for those

06:41.070 --> 06:41.930
browsers.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.340
Then we have this channel.

06:43.350 --> 06:48.450
This is the same brands and influences mini so Zada Georgie and Mario.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.350
So these are actually brands they are motivated with.

06:51.390 --> 06:59.730
So this is an actual you can say this is extracted from my research which I did with two users.

06:59.730 --> 07:01.380
So one is this busy mom.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.730
And one is a college girl.

07:03.730 --> 07:09.540
So this one is actual making decisions for my kids and buying clothes only for them before the start

07:09.540 --> 07:12.000
of season so this is their goal.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.650
So every season maybe summer or spring or winter they are going to you know make their purchases before

07:19.650 --> 07:24.660
that don't want to burden myself with extra load and frustrations.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.930
So as my life is already very hectic so this is their goals.

07:27.930 --> 07:36.450
They have these fears and frustrations that I don't want extra Lord I don't want extra work and I want

07:36.450 --> 07:43.500
to be free myself so always looking for things to go smoothly so this is the code that they don't want

07:43.500 --> 07:50.550
any you know setbacks when they are purchasing on lines or things like that then we have some background

07:50.640 --> 07:56.820
you can you write a whole story you will hear married three children a computer science in school doesn't

07:56.860 --> 07:58.970
like to spend hard time.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.420
So I have done all his.

08:01.620 --> 08:09.300
This is going to be hard hard time on shopping prefers to buy everything online he has several credit

08:09.300 --> 08:14.610
cards they should buy different banks mostly look for local clothing store ads on Instagram so you can

08:14.610 --> 08:20.460
also write a whole background story that she wakes up early in the morning she is very busy she goes

08:20.460 --> 08:27.090
to school before going to school she makes sure that her three children are ready and they and then

08:27.090 --> 08:28.790
she hurry up and things like that.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.980
So this is going to be a background of textures.

08:32.460 --> 08:38.620
So this is how we are going to create a persona you can add more personas I really like this.

08:39.210 --> 08:41.330
You express your template too.

08:41.370 --> 08:47.220
There is no standards but make sure you have goals you have quotation you have motivation and frustrations

08:47.550 --> 08:54.720
you have brand influences you have all you got for technology and how comfortable they are with this

08:54.720 --> 08:57.870
technology and some of our demographic background.

08:58.230 --> 08:59.250
So this image is dummy.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.460
This is Nazi that our mom does it is someone else.

09:02.460 --> 09:08.730
So that is all about using personas and creating one persona online.

09:08.730 --> 09:12.210
Your next assignment will be to create a persona like this one.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.060
So let's move on to the next lesson.
