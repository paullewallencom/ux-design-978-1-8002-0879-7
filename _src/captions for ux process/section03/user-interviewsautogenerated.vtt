WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:11.040
Now once you have done with stakeholders and you courted goals and what their aims are why are they

00:11.040 --> 00:11.910
building this product.

00:11.910 --> 00:14.050
We are going to move to our users.

00:14.100 --> 00:21.150
This is our most important party because if you cannot you know build anything that is going to solve

00:21.150 --> 00:23.040
your users problem.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.920
Your business is also going to fall apart.

00:26.070 --> 00:30.660
So you will lose a lot of business revenue profits.

00:30.660 --> 00:31.530
Anything you have.

00:31.860 --> 00:39.120
So we are going to do a user interview because we want to get more information about our users their

00:39.120 --> 00:46.130
behavior how they interact with their products or our products or our competitors products.

00:46.140 --> 00:50.400
So this is we are going to uncover in user interviews.

00:50.400 --> 00:55.170
So if you are planning for user interviews the first thing we are going to do is we are going to create

00:55.170 --> 00:57.480
some sections for user interviews.

00:57.480 --> 01:05.700
For example I have an e-commerce Web site so I cannot you know ask like 100 questions about everything

01:05.700 --> 01:10.730
about my users that how you do this how you do this how you do this.

01:10.860 --> 01:17.340
We are going to have our sections divided into a few major categories.

01:17.340 --> 01:23.620
For example I want to test new account set up for example sign up of my website.

01:23.730 --> 01:29.670
Then I want to see how our users log in or is there any problems in the log in section.

01:29.790 --> 01:37.720
Then I also want to learn what makes my user two pages anything on my website.

01:37.770 --> 01:40.210
So how what is the information.

01:40.320 --> 01:45.910
What is the key information that looks for when they want to buy something.

01:45.930 --> 01:49.300
What is involved in their purchasing decision.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.570
What are their fears.

01:50.580 --> 01:57.670
Why are they afraid to use my website or B use my payment gateway or things like that.

01:57.690 --> 02:00.750
I am also going to test my checkered process.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.690
So I want to see how seamless is my checkout process.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.780
I can do this in a lot of ways.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.860
We are going to see them in the next few slides.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.990
So let's get ahead now.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.770
We have already divided different sections that we want to death.

02:15.780 --> 02:23.610
These portions or these tasks or these functions are features of any website or e-commerce site.

02:23.610 --> 02:33.710
We are actually building which is frock land and you can see the miss major thing we skipped is motivations.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.010
What actually more TV X my user to use my website.

02:38.010 --> 02:39.730
What are their goals.

02:39.870 --> 02:42.090
Why are they on this website.

02:42.090 --> 02:48.930
What are their fears what have what is keeping them away or what is going to frustrate them.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.100
In the first place.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.630
So these are the few questions you can see I have listed over here.

02:54.780 --> 03:01.320
For what reason you will choose this princess as how quickly do you want the delivery to be what should

03:01.320 --> 03:04.240
be written in The Help Line sections things like that.

03:04.240 --> 03:13.830
So we sometimes don't want to ask these very direct questions we might want to rephrase them like what

03:13.830 --> 03:15.660
is the best help line.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.500
You have seen in similar e-commerce websites.

03:20.520 --> 03:26.000
So if the user shows you on their website and they show you that this is the help line.

03:26.010 --> 03:28.170
I really loved you.

03:28.290 --> 03:32.470
You ask them again that what you really loved about it.

03:32.580 --> 03:39.420
So they are going to you are going to explore and you are going to like book your users and ask Balkan

03:39.420 --> 03:41.500
questions what you loved about it.

03:41.610 --> 03:47.760
Why do you love it and what's make you makes you think that this is the best solution or things like

03:47.760 --> 03:48.390
that.

03:48.450 --> 03:55.230
So we are going to get more information more and more information because we want to use this and improve

03:55.260 --> 04:02.820
our product which is Franklin which is about Princess says dresses our little girl or little princess

04:02.820 --> 04:03.890
dress.

04:03.990 --> 04:08.460
So these are the things you want to ask in your user interview.

04:08.460 --> 04:13.370
Now this happens a lot when you are going to do the user.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.390
You can see user interview for the first time.

04:15.420 --> 04:21.230
When I did for the first time the first user I actually you talked a lot.

04:21.390 --> 04:26.900
So this is the thing you need to you know stop and you need to control yourself.

04:26.910 --> 04:29.240
Don't try to talk a lot.

04:29.310 --> 04:36.320
Ask small very directed questions and don't give a lot of guidance to the user.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.590
Don't tell them that.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.910
Do you use credit card to be online.

04:40.920 --> 04:47.580
Instead you can ask Which method do you prefer to be online so they might have something else in their

04:47.580 --> 04:50.230
mind they might not be using credit card.

04:50.280 --> 04:56.400
For example in my side or in my country credit cards are not used to be online.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.760
Most of the 90 percent of the customers they actually use be at your doorstep.

05:01.770 --> 05:08.310
So the package arrives you collect it and you pay the price to the delivery company.

05:08.310 --> 05:14.910
So this is a totally different mechanism in my country and there are few more services like easy best

05:14.910 --> 05:21.560
are for more online payment systems that are not actually you being used by credit cards.

05:21.570 --> 05:27.220
Now let's talk about some probing questions and how you are going to ask them probing questions I'd

05:27.230 --> 05:30.150
be actually supportive questions for.

05:30.150 --> 05:36.420
A main question you have asked for example if I have asked my user that what problems you have faced

05:36.810 --> 05:43.920
with item delivery or return of the item last time you ordered some clothes and wants the answer this

05:44.430 --> 05:48.690
and I'm going to ask another question to get more information maybe.

05:48.710 --> 05:52.130
I don't ask how would you like to return your product.

05:52.130 --> 05:53.800
Maybe something else.

05:53.940 --> 05:55.840
And depending on the answer.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.050
So what I want the answer.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.190
Try to poke into it.

05:58.190 --> 06:06.020
Try to probe it try to see what else and what other information you can extract from your user.

06:06.080 --> 06:13.480
Okay so a lot of time more stuff all the newbies that are going to you do some user interviews.

06:13.670 --> 06:17.340
The first thing they are going to miss is user context.

06:17.510 --> 06:24.680
So whenever you are actually interviewing a user you are going to interview in their home or office

06:24.680 --> 06:28.640
or whatever device they use to order online or things like that.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.420
They might have very slow internet connection.

06:31.610 --> 06:38.390
They might have a very old iPhone or they might have a very old desktop P.C. that is very slow to load.

06:38.570 --> 06:42.530
So you need to see what are there.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.450
What is their environment.

06:44.450 --> 06:52.700
What are the hardware or the software they are using to complete their different tasks.

06:52.790 --> 06:53.920
So things like that.

06:54.020 --> 07:01.190
So you are also going to print your material for example you want to show your user that these are the

07:01.190 --> 07:05.640
questions or these are the products I want to explore with you.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.820
Show me the process or things like that.

07:08.420 --> 07:11.030
You can also record audio or video if you want.

07:11.030 --> 07:17.750
You can also take pictures of their contacts their room and their hardware nor down what they are using

07:18.920 --> 07:22.480
and at least try to interview three to five users.

07:22.730 --> 07:26.150
So this is actually very important.

07:26.180 --> 07:31.990
At least three users and there is one more user interview technique that is called Gorilla and gorilla

07:32.000 --> 07:38.630
user interviews and what you do there is you actually go to any bar or cafe and get your friends or

07:38.630 --> 07:45.620
anyone and give them a coffee cup of coffee and show them that this is I want to ask you a few questions

07:45.620 --> 07:51.770
about this product and I want to show you something and then I keep asking them questions like ten or

07:51.770 --> 07:52.660
twelve questions.

07:52.760 --> 07:53.990
So this is gorilla testing.

07:53.990 --> 08:01.190
It is very cheap and it is very effective sometimes but they the users you are testing they might not

08:01.190 --> 08:06.350
be the actual users that use your app but you can get some.

08:06.380 --> 08:13.670
You can see some impressions of your product about by going through this gorilla user testing.

08:13.670 --> 08:18.350
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson of user interview I'm going to share with you the document.

08:18.350 --> 08:23.110
You can download for the user interview questions I have listed.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.670
I hope you enjoyed this lesson.

08:25.670 --> 08:28.820
Stay tuned and see you soon in the next.
