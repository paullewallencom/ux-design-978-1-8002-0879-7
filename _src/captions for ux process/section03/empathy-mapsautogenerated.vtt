In this video we are going to talk about empathy maps.

00:06.720 --> 00:13.440
Now a lot of my students they have asked me that please include these empathy maps and tell us about

00:13.770 --> 00:14.570
what are these.

00:14.580 --> 00:15.990
Empathy maps.

00:15.990 --> 00:18.180
And how do we use them now.

00:18.180 --> 00:25.110
Empathy map is actually a collaborative tool which we are going to use to get more into the head and

00:25.110 --> 00:28.350
heart of our users or our customers.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.780
We are going to see what are they saying.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.270
What are they thinking.

00:32.310 --> 00:36.070
What are their feelings and what actually are they doing.

00:36.090 --> 00:45.060
So what our users do is not sometimes the same as they are feeling or thinking and saying So this is

00:45.570 --> 00:54.000
the map we actually draw for different sections on a page where we will point out what a user was saying

00:54.350 --> 00:59.780
and at the same time what he was thinking or she was thinking what were their feelings while whether

00:59.780 --> 01:05.130
they are afraid whether they were confused things like that and what they were actually doing whether

01:05.130 --> 01:10.680
they were clicking the by Norbert and again and again and they were feeling dumb and they were thinking

01:10.680 --> 01:17.790
what is happening why it is not giving me any feedback that my card has been my order has been confirmed

01:17.790 --> 01:18.610
or not.

01:18.690 --> 01:23.760
And they might be saying that I am not sure maybe I am doing something wrong.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.920
So as you can see there are contradiction and difference differences between what they are thinking

01:28.920 --> 01:33.200
seeing saying feeling and doing.

01:33.210 --> 01:40.280
Now let's talk about why we actually do empathy maps and what are the benefits we we can get from them.

01:40.480 --> 01:46.920
Now the first thing is that we are actually uncovering user needs and most of the times users are not

01:46.920 --> 01:49.350
aware of what they actually want.

01:49.350 --> 01:56.700
So we want to see what they are actually thinking what are their emotional needs.

01:57.030 --> 02:04.590
How we can make them comfortable using our app or how we can improve our trust and things like that.

02:04.590 --> 02:08.280
So we are going to also get into user behavior.

02:08.790 --> 02:15.280
So most of the things we are doing over here is actually seeing what how they are going to behave.

02:15.580 --> 02:17.470
What are the triggers that are going to

02:21.290 --> 02:25.060
what is triggering these user behaviors.

02:25.070 --> 02:35.110
So this is going to get an so we are actually digging deeper into our users feelings and what are the

02:35.110 --> 02:36.690
problems they have.

02:36.730 --> 02:43.320
What are the fears they have and what are they thinking what are what is the emotional state.

02:43.330 --> 02:50.680
So these are all the things that we are going to use and map out in our empathy maps.

02:50.690 --> 02:52.370
Let me show you one example.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.170
And then we have we will move on to the next lesson.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.790
Now here is an example of empathy map.

02:59.810 --> 03:04.510
This is from an in group non Nielsen Norman I think Norman Nielsen.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.450
I don't remember.

03:05.460 --> 03:12.470
Anyhow you can see flossing is you are going to notice is at the top over here buying a TV so you need

03:12.470 --> 03:19.100
to show the process they are the user is actually going through so maybe some task maybe checkout process

03:19.100 --> 03:20.570
or things like that.

03:20.600 --> 03:27.470
So this is actually Jaimee which is actually your user persona might be your user persona and you are

03:27.470 --> 03:31.690
going to attach a user and a process to your empathy map.

03:31.730 --> 03:37.770
These are two things then we are going to have a section or here where we are going to post whatever

03:37.850 --> 03:44.580
they are thinking whatever they are feeling what actually the user is doing and what he actually sees.

03:44.600 --> 03:51.050
So he might be saying something and doing something else and he might be thinking something you have

03:51.050 --> 03:57.350
to ask those user please think aloud What are you thinking and what are you feeling why are you afraid

03:57.350 --> 03:58.450
of doing this.

03:58.730 --> 03:59.930
What is happening over here.

03:59.930 --> 04:02.630
Tell me how you are feeling right now.

04:02.690 --> 04:10.340
So you are going to ask these questions while user is performing this task which is buying a TV in this

04:10.340 --> 04:11.800
example.

04:11.830 --> 04:16.450
So this is how actually you create an empathy map.

04:16.450 --> 04:20.030
So that is all if you have any questions to ask me.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.910
Let's move on to the next lesson.
