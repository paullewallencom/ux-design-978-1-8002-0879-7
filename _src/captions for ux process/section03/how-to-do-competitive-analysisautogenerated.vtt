00:05.210 --> 00:10.850
In this video we're going to talk about competitive analysis and what it was you were building whether

00:10.850 --> 00:16.460
it's a Web site or app or new product that is revolutionary.

00:16.460 --> 00:22.230
There will always be some sort of competition.

00:22.460 --> 00:29.150
So by competition I mean there must be some products that are similar to your product or they are close

00:29.150 --> 00:29.960
to your product.

00:30.410 --> 00:32.750
So I don't think that there is no competition.

00:32.750 --> 00:39.080
There will always be some competition or some competitor to your product.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.270
So why would we do this.

00:41.270 --> 00:50.150
We are going to check and benchmark our app our website or our product with other similar products so

00:50.150 --> 00:54.290
we are going to see where we stand in this race.

00:54.290 --> 00:55.610
So this is very important.

00:55.610 --> 01:02.510
It is going to give you a lot of in-depth analysis of what the competition is doing and what we should

01:02.510 --> 01:03.440
do.

01:03.470 --> 01:09.140
Now the question is What are different factors you should test with your competitors.

01:09.260 --> 01:16.490
Now the first thing is in my case which is from clan website I'm going to check navigation information

01:16.490 --> 01:23.160
architecture how they are moving the customers from the logon page to the checkout page.

01:23.210 --> 01:29.840
Then the second one will be product information and it is for are different frocks or dresses informations

01:30.680 --> 01:36.410
or pieces of information that are present on other websites what are their standards.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.760
Similarly we are also going to see trust and credibility.

01:39.770 --> 01:45.200
So how much and why our customers.

01:45.200 --> 01:51.270
They have more trust on other brand or maybe other e-commerce store or maybe other app.

01:51.290 --> 01:59.360
Why their usage and why they think that it is more credible than I also have asked few things about

01:59.390 --> 02:02.240
onboarding log in and sign ups.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.610
You are also going to see what our different call to actions.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.120
What are the labels they have been using.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.390
How effective they are.

02:09.410 --> 02:13.730
Call to actions are for example Biden or button or add to card.

02:13.730 --> 02:16.110
You have seen on Amazon dot com.

02:16.250 --> 02:22.460
It is strictly different from the whole bid and it is orange and yellow and they really attract the

02:22.460 --> 02:23.000
customer.

02:23.930 --> 02:30.230
Similarly we want to see the checkout process because each website each e-commerce platform there are

02:30.230 --> 02:32.630
different rules different checkout process.

02:32.720 --> 02:40.520
So if you are building any app or anything these things will be different for those so if you will in

02:40.520 --> 02:43.300
my case I was testing e-commerce Web site.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.890
So I have listed these few things which I am going to test with my competitors.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.050
Now how we are going to conduct competitive analysis.

02:53.510 --> 03:02.120
The thing is that you need to ask your users during the interview to order something or to use your

03:02.120 --> 03:04.590
competitors website.

03:04.640 --> 03:11.960
I actually did it and it is the best way to learn what they have in their products and what they lack

03:12.050 --> 03:13.250
in their products.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.560
What are their strengths.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.410
What are their weaknesses.

03:16.460 --> 03:22.870
Because we need to see what our different usability problems are the when my customer.

03:22.910 --> 03:26.360
They go to another e-commerce website or a similar app.

03:26.360 --> 03:34.100
I am building what are the problems they face how and which areas are sections of the app we can improve

03:34.250 --> 03:37.940
or we have opportunity to improve that.

03:37.940 --> 03:45.530
So in this whole competitive analysis we are going to look at different sections which we think are

03:45.590 --> 03:46.880
essential to our app.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.890
We are also going to benchmark our system or our app.

03:50.900 --> 03:58.040
If we already have an app we are going to benchmark it said that right now we stand at 60 percent or

03:58.820 --> 04:04.500
we give our our self like 50 percent on log in.

04:04.520 --> 04:11.240
So our logon is 50 percent easier with respect to the standards which others are following.

04:11.270 --> 04:12.980
So we need to improve that.

04:13.010 --> 04:20.900
So whenever you are doing user experience process or you will expense research or user interviews there

04:20.900 --> 04:29.270
will be two scenarios whether you already have the product build or you have to build a product from

04:29.270 --> 04:37.070
scratch so these are two points from where you will always start your user experience design process.

04:37.160 --> 04:46.370
So in both processes you are going to check your website your app your your mobile app or whatever you

04:46.370 --> 04:49.670
are building your product with your competition.

04:49.670 --> 04:55.190
So even if it's not a digital product you are still going to check it with similar products already

04:55.190 --> 04:56.160
built.

04:56.180 --> 05:03.380
Now let me show you the document I prepared and what I did in my competitive analysis and you can download

05:03.380 --> 05:09.380
this competitive analysis document from this lesson in the resources.

05:09.380 --> 05:12.070
So don't worry that you will not get it.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.300
There are different formats I am going to show you.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.660
It is very easy.

05:15.770 --> 05:17.330
Don't worry at all.

05:17.330 --> 05:24.790
Let's see this example now here is my comparative analysis for Franklin.

05:24.870 --> 05:30.630
And you can see I have written all here tested for log and sign up credibility searching filtering and

05:30.630 --> 05:34.050
check out process so you can see here.

05:34.050 --> 05:40.950
I have tested my competitors main competitors were that I was taught be gay which is one of the biggest

05:40.980 --> 05:43.460
online store in my country.

05:43.530 --> 05:47.770
Then I have sharp hive which is very old and very credible online store.

05:47.790 --> 05:54.950
Then we have e export left towards yellow which have different kind of category of goods to sell.

05:55.290 --> 06:02.850
So I needed to see what are different online competitors and what are their strengths and weaknesses.

06:02.850 --> 06:09.750
Now if we talk about shop hive they are very credible but they are not related to my niche which is

06:09.750 --> 06:15.260
clothing so sharp hive was related to.

06:15.450 --> 06:24.780
You can say technology products so they are selling computers things like that but I included it just

06:24.780 --> 06:32.510
to see how the checkout process is and how their logging is and how the sign up is so you can see here

06:32.520 --> 06:38.040
are different strengths like like drawers is the biggest store variety of products to select from already

06:38.040 --> 06:42.060
established well-known guard and wish list are powerful.

06:42.060 --> 06:47.790
There are very powerful features you can easily move your item to wishlist and from wishlist to cart

06:48.360 --> 06:55.480
search and many filter options because it is a very big platform and now coming to the weaknesses slowed

06:55.490 --> 06:55.980
delivery.

06:56.010 --> 07:01.850
So I have seen I have ordered myself and hard about about its ordering problems.

07:01.860 --> 07:09.240
That and this delivery is very slow sometimes it takes 7 days sometimes 5 sometimes 10 days sometimes

07:09.330 --> 07:12.970
you even don't get your product even for a month.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.230
Too many suppliers.

07:15.230 --> 07:17.330
Quality is insurance is not good.

07:17.330 --> 07:26.690
So there are too many shops that are supplying on drugs so it is a very messy with suppliers.

07:27.060 --> 07:34.440
When we go to check out there was no clear payment method selection selection section so it was difficult

07:34.440 --> 07:41.520
for the user to see which method should I select or it is it selected or not.

07:41.820 --> 07:46.890
No option for to filter by fabric time which is our main.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.840
You can say aha moment for filtering.

07:50.850 --> 07:57.140
We are going to add this fabric dye filtering to our website which is frankly an e-commerce store then

07:57.140 --> 07:58.420
we have sharp hive.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.820
There are different strengths and weaknesses.

08:00.830 --> 08:02.640
Similarly from yellow.

08:02.750 --> 08:11.190
So the main layout of this whole competitive analysis will be competitors and some of their description.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.350
If you can use the online you are that is okay.

08:15.450 --> 08:17.370
Then we have some of the strengths.

08:17.370 --> 08:18.960
Then we have some of the weaknesses.

08:18.990 --> 08:25.600
So this is actually the main template for your competitive analysis.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.310
Let's let me show you one more template extensible.

08:29.310 --> 08:32.710
I have already shown you this app and you can see over here.

08:32.710 --> 08:35.580
Here is again we have competitive analysis.

08:35.580 --> 08:42.950
And here we have you can say our top down layout for the same thing we did image of the competitor of

08:42.960 --> 08:44.260
logo with here.

08:44.280 --> 08:49.400
Then we have complete a name location size of the company that how big is it.

08:49.590 --> 08:55.680
For example like the last dot com authorized are big in my case it was the biggest very big online store

08:56.060 --> 09:03.510
and then some of the description if you can use the jurors on the Web you can use that product photo

09:03.510 --> 09:06.370
if you want to list over here.

09:06.430 --> 09:13.680
And then again the main area or section which is strength and weaknesses so weaknesses are the things

09:13.680 --> 09:17.070
we have we are going to learn and we are going to grow from this.

09:17.130 --> 09:20.670
We are going to learn from the weaknesses of others.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.480
This is how we are going to improve our user experience.

09:24.510 --> 09:28.870
Okay so here is another section which which is called market breakdown.

09:28.920 --> 09:33.240
It is showing us the kind of competitor we are dealing with.

09:33.240 --> 09:40.140
So whether it's a very premium budget you can say that it is very costly to build something like that

09:40.630 --> 09:46.950
but it is business to business or business to consumer kind of competition or Web site or e-commerce

09:47.220 --> 09:51.690
whether it's e-commerce retail local or global services or products.

09:51.690 --> 09:52.870
What are the selling.

09:52.950 --> 09:53.870
So things like that.

09:53.870 --> 10:00.270
It is just to get the estimate of how much costly the competitor is if you will want to build something

10:00.270 --> 10:02.880
similar it will be very costly or things like that.

10:02.880 --> 10:10.440
So this is main template if you want to see it is going to be an extension of upside competitive comprehensive

10:10.470 --> 10:17.340
analysis and that is going to sum up my this lesson which I think is really important.

10:17.370 --> 10:22.440
You need to compare your products with others similar products to see where we can improve where we

10:22.440 --> 10:29.190
can have some standard function which others are expecting our users are expecting that checkout should

10:29.190 --> 10:35.190
have these many steps or these many options which is industry standards we are going to find these two

10:35.190 --> 10:39.650
things industry standards and weaknesses where we can improve.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.240
So that is all about competitive analysis.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.930
I think we should move on to the next N.S.A..
