00:04.810 --> 00:13.260
Whenever we are doing our user express design process there are tons of features that your user might

00:13.260 --> 00:14.010
want.

00:14.100 --> 00:21.930
So they might want to you know pack their laundry or maybe vehicle them up with a smile or things like

00:21.930 --> 00:22.230
that.

00:22.260 --> 00:27.450
They can ask for anything they can even ask for magic.

00:27.450 --> 00:34.990
So what you are going to do is we cannot develop or design all those features.

00:35.070 --> 00:36.750
Everything is not possible.

00:36.750 --> 00:40.490
It might be due to some limitations of cost.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.860
It might be limitation of time.

00:43.080 --> 00:47.040
It might be limitation of development process.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.360
Maybe it's difficult to develop.

00:49.500 --> 00:57.480
So we are actually going to trade off and select the features using the feature metrics and we are going

00:57.480 --> 01:00.060
to see what feature is valuable.

01:00.300 --> 01:07.620
And also we can easily build it so it is cost effective valuable and less time consuming.

01:08.400 --> 01:17.360
Similarly when we are improving or redesigning or improving our design maybe we release our first version

01:17.400 --> 01:20.130
and we got some feedback from the users.

01:20.130 --> 01:25.050
Now we are going to release our second version and we want to improve it.

01:25.080 --> 01:31.560
We are again going to build feature metrics that these features can be or these problems can be adjusted

01:31.590 --> 01:32.450
easily.

01:32.460 --> 01:36.340
They have more value so we are going to do them first.

01:36.360 --> 01:42.090
So this is actually to prioritize which features you want to develop first and which we are going to

01:42.090 --> 01:43.190
develop later.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.180
So let me show you one example.

01:46.350 --> 01:54.010
Now you can see this is how you develop feature metrics and you can see on the left side we have value

01:54.010 --> 01:54.610
to user.

01:54.660 --> 02:00.070
How much value our product has or this feature has for the user.

02:00.090 --> 02:06.480
So from low to high then we have on the bottom we have from the left or right we have difficulty or

02:06.480 --> 02:07.950
cost of implementation.

02:07.950 --> 02:16.950
It might be cost in monetary terms like dollars or it might be time so you can see our resources from

02:16.950 --> 02:17.730
the left right.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.120
We have low and too high.

02:19.590 --> 02:27.030
So you can see the features that are going to fall in this quadrant which are expensive and high value

02:27.480 --> 02:30.160
like automatic Stock Alerts to suppliers.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.510
So it is not very necessary.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.040
We are not going to build them right now.

02:35.070 --> 02:41.460
Similarly package tracking in my country there is no package tracking online or you can see you can

02:42.000 --> 02:45.180
visually see your package going through different drugs.

02:45.180 --> 02:51.570
This is not possible so we are going to leave those then on the left you can see easy wins.

02:51.570 --> 02:55.860
They have high value and they have very low cost.

02:55.860 --> 03:01.050
So on the left you can see Facebook log in is easier to develop than we have taking all in order by

03:01.050 --> 03:01.380
phone.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.580
It is not very difficult.

03:02.580 --> 03:08.680
We just need a phone number and it is also going to improve the trust and credibility of our website.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.090
E-commerce website filtering based on color size and fabric.

03:12.090 --> 03:13.780
This can be done easily.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.980
We just need to have a few filters applied.

03:17.160 --> 03:23.790
So when you are making this decision or this matrix we are going to have our developers.

03:23.910 --> 03:26.850
We are going to have our Martin marketing managers.

03:26.850 --> 03:30.980
We are going to have our CEO and we are going to have our design team.

03:31.020 --> 03:37.220
All of them should be present and they are going to give some points that these are easier to develop

03:37.230 --> 03:43.080
are these are easy wins or things like that because user expands design team they know what are the

03:43.080 --> 03:49.620
pain points development team they know what are development costs marketing teams they know what actually

03:50.250 --> 03:58.350
user wants to see too or our feature that we can market easily for example sorting by fabric type so

03:58.350 --> 03:59.070
things like that.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.220
So on the left side you can see we have low cost low value.

04:03.150 --> 04:10.260
So log in option with just a phone number that can be implemented to it has medium to low value and

04:10.260 --> 04:11.520
it has very low cost.

04:11.910 --> 04:18.270
So anything that is going to fall in this section in this area we are going to implement it or try to

04:18.270 --> 04:28.680
create it in our first vision or MVP minimum minimal viable product and everything that is expensive

04:28.710 --> 04:29.470
and low value.

04:29.490 --> 04:33.180
We are going to neglect it almost totally.

04:33.180 --> 04:34.350
So things like that.

04:34.350 --> 04:41.430
So this is actually very important in decision making because we don't want to our product to be a feature

04:41.430 --> 04:45.200
creep I have I had a client.

04:45.230 --> 04:47.720
I'm going to tell you a little story.

04:47.770 --> 04:56.440
I had a client and he had a brilliant idea and a product which was in web app and what it does it was

04:56.440 --> 04:57.420
a community app.

04:57.760 --> 05:07.810
So if you are in town for example my town or my area is called DC Colonia or D.C. road or things like

05:07.810 --> 05:07.980
that.

05:07.980 --> 05:16.030
So if I am living in at the loony like D.C. colony and on that app you can join that community and everyone

05:16.030 --> 05:23.050
is going to inform you about what actually is happening around them maybe they hired some thief last

05:23.050 --> 05:28.900
night they heard some gunshot last night so they are going to inform you about the safety and other

05:28.900 --> 05:31.200
things and what is happening in the community.

05:31.210 --> 05:36.430
Maybe some advertized mind that I am selling I am opening a new shop for this thing and things like

05:36.430 --> 05:45.730
that so it was a brilliant idea but the problem was that he actually suffocated the app with like tons

05:45.730 --> 05:46.690
of features.

05:46.690 --> 05:53.900
There were 20 different features that were not needed by the his users.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
So he was my client from USA and the idea was great.

05:58.030 --> 06:04.830
I left that project because it was getting getting bigger and bigger with a lot of features.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.510
I was a designer as you would expect designer for that.

06:07.630 --> 06:14.950
That was a social app category and I had very bad experience of because of this feature creep.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.450
So this is very important.

06:16.450 --> 06:24.640
I think it is going to make or break your app because you cannot deliver everything at a time so you

06:24.640 --> 06:30.970
have to select few priorities you have to prioritize which features are more essential or they are the

06:30.970 --> 06:32.790
bread and butter of my app.

06:32.890 --> 06:37.430
Users are going to attract to my app with this feature.

06:37.840 --> 06:44.860
So try to develop those which have high value and you can easily make them in within six months or three

06:44.860 --> 06:47.940
months technology is very fast paced.

06:47.980 --> 06:56.020
If you are going to make or improve feature and you are going to introduce it within next five years

06:56.470 --> 07:00.640
then you are going to lose the business because it is changing a lot.

07:00.640 --> 07:07.450
There might be tens of apps that are going to deliver that feature and maybe before you.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.640
So it's a race.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.780
So try to focus on what is high value and you can easily develop it.

07:13.810 --> 07:14.440
Easy wins.

07:15.400 --> 07:20.710
So that is all about this feature matrix and the story I have told you I hope you have learned some

07:20.710 --> 07:21.910
lessons.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.380
Let's move on to the next lesson.
