00:04.290 --> 00:10.350
Now in this lesson we are going to talk about personas you might have heard this name before.

00:10.350 --> 00:16.830
If you are a UI designer or you design it now a lot of people think that it is a real user but instead

00:16.890 --> 00:20.470
it is actually a fictitious user.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.450
And we don't use the real image of the user.

00:24.450 --> 00:30.330
For example I went to an interview and I took a photo of my user and then I pasted in my personas.

00:30.330 --> 00:30.990
This is wrong.

00:30.990 --> 00:38.680
We are going to use just a fake image and the name must also be fake by about all the other information

00:39.130 --> 00:43.720
will be will not be fake it will be real now it actually does.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.220
What are the behaviors what are the goals.

00:47.350 --> 00:51.280
What what are the triggers behind those goals of future users.

00:51.280 --> 00:57.490
Because these this is very necessary you need to know and understand your users better what are their

00:57.490 --> 01:06.260
behaviors how they act with different technologies and all this stuff now normally we get all the information

01:06.260 --> 01:13.250
from our personas and the user interviews so we you know we all we extract all the information from

01:13.250 --> 01:18.390
there from the user interviews and put and create a persona based on that.

01:18.410 --> 01:23.180
Now I recommend that you should use at least three personas.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.170
One two three personas.

01:25.250 --> 01:31.160
Normally it is very rare that you just hit only one type of person.

01:31.490 --> 01:39.170
So actually there is another topic that is coming to my mind which is a user archetype or user RG type

01:39.180 --> 01:40.330
whatever you call it.

01:40.370 --> 01:44.070
So actually persona is actually one type of user.

01:44.120 --> 01:52.090
For example I have for example I have a website that gives me different.

01:52.130 --> 01:53.980
You can say different deals.

01:54.170 --> 01:54.550
OK.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.090
So it is a deal.

01:56.090 --> 02:00.260
The upside that give me all the discounted deals online.

02:00.290 --> 02:03.890
So there might be two different types of users for that.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.870
So there will be two different personas.

02:05.870 --> 02:08.630
One is a normal home user.

02:08.630 --> 02:16.790
For example I want few t shirts for me and I saw a bulk t shirt deal over there that five t shirts for

02:16.790 --> 02:18.530
20 dollars and I'm going to buy it.

02:18.560 --> 02:18.910
OK.

02:19.190 --> 02:21.700
So there is one type of person like this.

02:21.830 --> 02:30.620
There could be another persona and another type of user that is going to buy in bulk and he's going

02:30.620 --> 02:32.080
to sell on his shop.

02:32.090 --> 02:33.940
So he has a shop.

02:34.010 --> 02:41.690
He has a clothing shop our store and he is going to buy all different stuff in bulk that he can get

02:41.690 --> 02:44.230
from that dealers website.

02:44.360 --> 02:50.810
And in another season or maybe next season he is going to store it and he is going to you know sell

02:50.810 --> 02:52.930
it on some other rates.

02:53.180 --> 02:53.980
So there could.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.870
So we can make one persona for the home user.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.600
And we are going to name it home use it.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.050
And the second one will be sell.

03:01.070 --> 03:01.810
So.

03:01.820 --> 03:05.440
So these are different types of personas you are looking for.

03:05.510 --> 03:12.320
Now the second question is why do we need personas why creating these personas why should we have these.

03:12.380 --> 03:19.900
So the first thing is that we want our design team our development team to have some empathy VW users.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.130
They need to know what are the pains of our users what are the goals and the personality of the user

03:25.130 --> 03:27.820
who is going to use their product.

03:27.830 --> 03:33.950
So these personas they are printed and they are hanged in front of design teams and development teams

03:33.950 --> 03:39.350
so they can better align their user goals with their product.

03:39.350 --> 03:46.420
So this is going to you know give them a shared bot that our user is going to need these.

03:46.430 --> 03:48.800
So we are building this for this type of user.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.320
So this is very important.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.610
You might have heard about a persona.

03:53.630 --> 03:56.690
But you might not have heard about work rules.

03:56.900 --> 04:02.360
You are developing a product or an e-commerce store for the users primarily your buyers and you are

04:02.360 --> 04:03.940
making personas for them.

04:04.010 --> 04:11.870
But don't forget about the work rules work rules are actually different interesting parties that are

04:11.870 --> 04:13.780
linked to your product.

04:13.940 --> 04:22.250
For example in this example we are creating Franklin store so our buyers reject the other users we have

04:22.250 --> 04:27.440
created them to be personas are Goober sonars busy moms or things like that we are going to come to

04:27.440 --> 04:36.140
that point and we might also have administrator who is looking after all my products with adding products

04:36.140 --> 04:40.220
on my website who is removing products from my website.

04:40.250 --> 04:40.540
OK.

04:40.610 --> 04:44.120
So this is the site administrator then we have Cody and company.

04:44.300 --> 04:49.760
So the courier company delivery company that is attached to our Web site they are going to update our

04:49.760 --> 04:56.070
website our users that the product or delivery has been processed or things like that.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.840
Then we have the CEO now the CEO of the company which is me.

05:00.950 --> 05:03.550
I want different sales reports.

05:03.590 --> 05:04.810
I am not an administrator.

05:04.820 --> 05:06.290
I am administrator is different.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.240
So I want sales reports.

05:08.240 --> 05:15.500
So our website or our map store it might had some feature built in that it can show me monthly sales

05:15.500 --> 05:22.430
and yearly says our weekly says things like that then we have our stock manager stock manager is a separate

05:22.430 --> 05:24.380
person who is managing all the stock.

05:24.390 --> 05:29.840
So these kind of banks we have very low stock and he need to order more.

05:29.840 --> 05:34.920
So stock manager is actually totally different Volker rule.

05:34.940 --> 05:40.880
So you need to understand Don't try to forget about the Volcker Rule store just only focus on the users

05:41.240 --> 05:48.710
but all the different types of Volcker rules that are going to be interested in your in using your system

05:48.710 --> 05:49.620
or product.

05:49.730 --> 05:51.900
So enough talk about personas.

05:51.900 --> 05:57.530
I'm going to show you my persona which I created and I'm going to also show you a website where you

05:57.530 --> 06:02.690
can create online tool a persona they have very great templates.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.610
So let's move on to the next lesson.
