00:04.600 --> 00:08.500
Now the second test we are going to do is exploration test.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.970
Now this is very simple.

00:09.990 --> 00:15.760
We are going to leave our user on the front page of the first screen of our app and let them explore

00:15.850 --> 00:17.640
the app the website.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.620
And we are while did do that.

00:19.630 --> 00:25.600
We are going to record their screen their emotions and see actually what actually they are doing on

00:25.600 --> 00:27.550
our screen or the website.

00:27.550 --> 00:29.990
Now I'm going to give you a very useful tip here.

00:30.310 --> 00:37.360
If yours user asks you what this button does never answer this question instead answer this question

00:37.360 --> 00:40.430
with another question which is what do you think it should do.

00:40.780 --> 00:47.350
So this is going to help you become a better usability tester or usability analysis guy.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.010
So this is actually very important.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.570
Now why actually we are doing exploration test.

00:52.570 --> 00:55.320
We are actually testing the many users mental model.

00:55.330 --> 01:01.450
We are going to see which parts our of our product are most attracted to our users.

01:01.450 --> 01:03.720
What are the first steps they are going to take.

01:03.810 --> 01:07.690
Vedder they are going to click on subscription or whether they are good.

01:07.690 --> 01:11.660
They are going to go over the downloading a PDA for that.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.150
They are going to contact us or things like that.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.760
What are the first things they are going to look at.

01:16.780 --> 01:21.490
By that they are looking for some return policy or things like that.

01:21.490 --> 01:25.350
So this is actually first time usage exploration test.

01:25.360 --> 01:32.480
We are going to test out users that what are the things that they are testing or checking on our Web

01:32.480 --> 01:33.690
sites.

01:33.700 --> 01:43.090
Second most important thing is that emotional response whether they were showing interest in our product

01:43.510 --> 01:49.870
whether they were and they did you feel that they were ease at ease during exploration they were not

01:49.870 --> 01:50.550
frustrated.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.870
So that is all about exploration tests.

01:52.870 --> 01:55.090
If you have any questions do ask me.

01:55.090 --> 01:57.010
Let's move on to the next lesson.
