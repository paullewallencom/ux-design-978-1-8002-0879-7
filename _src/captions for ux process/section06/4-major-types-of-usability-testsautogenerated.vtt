Usability tests are essential in any stage of your development or your design or even is in user investigation

00:15.390 --> 00:16.790
or user interviews.

00:16.830 --> 00:24.210
So once you have prototypes built for your product or you have a completed version of your product you

00:24.210 --> 00:26.550
are ready to test it with your actual users.

00:26.550 --> 00:29.030
That is actually the usability test.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.320
We are going to see what are the pain points.

00:31.320 --> 00:37.720
What are the frustrations that still are residing in our product and we are going to I did it and has

00:37.820 --> 00:45.870
removed most of the things we have done so far are already aligned with the users and it's his needs

00:45.870 --> 00:47.220
or hard needs.

00:47.220 --> 00:52.170
So right now we are actually testing whether we have met those needs.

00:52.170 --> 00:59.830
We are going to validate our assumptions that we have made a usable user friendly product or not.

00:59.850 --> 01:01.740
So there are many things.

01:01.740 --> 01:02.880
There are many terms.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.880
There are many details in usability tests.

01:05.900 --> 01:11.730
I am not going to go into too much depth but I am going to stick with just four types of tests that

01:11.850 --> 01:16.410
are essential for improving the usability of any product.

01:16.650 --> 01:23.820
And you can do them at home so don't worry that you need to you know go to some lab to do these usability

01:23.820 --> 01:25.140
tests.

01:25.200 --> 01:32.670
Now the first test you are going to do with your product with your app for your website is first impression

01:32.670 --> 01:33.310
test.

01:33.380 --> 01:39.060
The first impression test is actually also called five second test and it is very popular.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.890
This is going to be your first test.

01:40.920 --> 01:48.930
You need to see what your users first impressions and parts about your product what do they think about

01:48.930 --> 01:49.080
it.

01:49.080 --> 01:49.980
Do they trust it.

01:49.980 --> 01:51.240
Do they want to buy it.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.920
Do they want to use it.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.660
What is your message.

01:54.810 --> 02:00.930
Whether they are understanding your website's message or your apps message accurately or not.

02:01.830 --> 02:08.250
So these kind of things we are going to you know search in these first impression tests so you are going

02:08.250 --> 02:15.660
to show your users your website for the first five seconds and then hide it and ask them questions like

02:15.930 --> 02:19.510
What is this website about what are you going to do things like that.

02:19.500 --> 02:25.460
So you need to get the initial ideas of your users about your product or your website.

02:25.560 --> 02:34.530
Now walk around or exploration test is actually you are going to let your users browse your app try

02:34.530 --> 02:40.500
to see what are their impressions when they try to struggle with something when they try to browse different

02:40.500 --> 02:46.500
products in my Franklin Web site for example when they tried to apply some filters when they tried to

02:46.500 --> 02:52.380
do two different filters and different product details I want to see their impressions what are they

02:52.380 --> 02:53.760
thinking about it.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.180
What are their impressions.

02:55.230 --> 02:59.550
So don't let you know explore them for like one hour.

02:59.730 --> 03:06.180
Just give them five or 10 minutes to get familiar with the product or app and see their expression record

03:06.180 --> 03:06.410
them.

03:06.420 --> 03:06.990
If you can.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.540
That is the best thing.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.800
So these are really nice.

03:10.800 --> 03:15.400
You might catch few problems during these exploration tests.

03:15.510 --> 03:22.560
Now this is the most essential step or test in your usability test which is essential tasks test you

03:22.560 --> 03:30.540
are going to plan for different tasks that are essential to your each user persona.

03:30.540 --> 03:34.090
For example each user is going to create a new account.

03:34.230 --> 03:35.210
Then we have log in.

03:35.220 --> 03:36.540
Then we have checkout process.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.480
Then we have filtering products.

03:38.490 --> 03:44.280
Then we have removing products from your card and adding them back shopping cart checkout.

03:44.280 --> 03:52.620
So we are going to test these five or six essential tasks with like three to five users to see what

03:52.620 --> 03:59.960
we have achieved and we are going to compare our results with benchmarking them with other websites

04:00.060 --> 04:04.980
with other popular solutions and other popular e-commerce stores.

04:04.980 --> 04:11.550
Now in the end after you have conducted your usability tests in the end you are going to give your users

04:11.550 --> 04:14.150
some questionnaire and surveys that.

04:14.370 --> 04:16.860
How did you feel using this product.

04:16.860 --> 04:25.050
What were your expectations and how well do you think you are going to read from 1 to 10 about this

04:25.050 --> 04:25.950
product.

04:25.950 --> 04:35.160
And we are actually asking them you can say qualitative data which is a usability technique qualitative

04:35.160 --> 04:40.980
and quantitative quantitative as we are measuring different like clicks or times and things like that

04:41.370 --> 04:48.600
and quantitative sorry qualitative is that we are actually checking the satisfaction and emotional response

04:48.960 --> 04:54.620
of our users what is the product quality how satisfied our users are.

04:54.780 --> 04:58.290
How are they feeling after using their our product.

04:58.290 --> 05:04.830
So we are going to get the over all emotional satisfaction and user satisfaction.

05:04.830 --> 05:10.980
Why are these questionnaires so I hope you have understood this lesson we are going to see these in

05:10.980 --> 05:16.830
detail in the next lessons and I am also going to give you downloadable resources.

05:16.830 --> 05:19.210
Don't forget to download them.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.060
So let's move on to the next lesson.
