00:04.840 --> 00:09.820
In this video we are going to cover what is actually five second test and how we are going to conduct

00:09.820 --> 00:14.750
it and what are the questions we are going to ask our users during the after this test.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.020
So why actually we do it.

00:17.020 --> 00:23.140
We have to test what is the initial impact of our website on or our app on our users.

00:23.140 --> 00:26.530
What are their perceptions about our product.

00:26.530 --> 00:32.890
How actually they are going to perceive it and whether it's just worthy or valuable or not human mind

00:32.920 --> 00:39.910
actually takes three to five seconds to make up their mind about a product whether it's bad or cool

00:39.910 --> 00:44.140
or is it cheap or valuable things like that.

00:44.140 --> 00:50.110
So we are going to take three to five users and we are going to show them our product or our website

00:50.220 --> 00:56.500
or app for five seconds and then we are going to hide it and then we are going to ask a few questions

00:56.500 --> 00:58.140
about our product.

00:58.150 --> 01:01.040
So this is how actually we conduct five second test.

01:01.070 --> 01:06.370
Now let's talk about the questions you are going to ask them after you showed them your website or product

01:06.370 --> 01:08.410
for the first five seconds.

01:08.410 --> 01:11.170
What is this product or website about.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.870
So this is the first question.

01:13.090 --> 01:15.000
What do you think this is.

01:15.010 --> 01:17.980
Second is what do you think you can do with it.

01:18.010 --> 01:24.960
Why are you here and tied is what are your emotional feelings about it.

01:24.960 --> 01:32.130
Was it fun wasn't serious was it professional and things like that then we have trust trust ability

01:32.130 --> 01:36.500
test how trustworthy this website or this app looks to you.

01:36.510 --> 01:43.200
This is very important second as we are going to see how much they remembered about our product whether

01:43.680 --> 01:47.930
they saw it for the first five second whether it is memorable or not.

01:47.970 --> 01:49.600
So we are going to ask them.

01:49.770 --> 01:53.290
Can you tell me the name off of the product you see.

01:53.760 --> 01:59.850
And a few more questions like How would you describe this to your friend or your user about this blog

01:59.850 --> 02:03.760
if you want to tell that you have seen this website or product.

02:03.870 --> 02:04.640
What would you say.

02:04.650 --> 02:09.000
How would you explain it to us and a few more things you can ask.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.790
Is that what are the first steps you are going to take of what is the first step you are going to take

02:15.180 --> 02:19.020
on this Web site so these are all the questions you can ask.

02:19.020 --> 02:24.790
I'm going to give you a download downloadable resource to download all these questions seminar rate

02:24.840 --> 02:26.610
questions and you can start from there.

02:27.030 --> 02:32.200
Now why do we do our five second test and what our different facts about it.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.780
Now here is the thing.

02:33.780 --> 02:40.780
If you or if your user is using your web site and for the first few seconds they are unable to tell

02:40.800 --> 02:45.740
what is the message of your Web site or what it actually does.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.490
You are going to lose your business.

02:47.490 --> 02:49.450
They are going to go to a computer.

02:49.470 --> 02:57.390
So this is actually very you can see essential for you to test most startups and Kickstarter projects

02:57.400 --> 03:04.430
and I have seen a lot of apps and things like that Web sites landing pages that suffer from this.

03:04.470 --> 03:11.220
They have a very attractive message like solve your pain and that is all.

03:11.220 --> 03:12.260
And then the product.

03:12.570 --> 03:20.100
So I don't I have a lot of behinds which being actually to solving whether it's my muscle pain or any.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.260
You can see a psychological pain or whatever actually.

03:23.290 --> 03:27.630
And so this is very confusing you have to be clear about your message.

03:27.630 --> 03:35.700
Let me show you a few examples one for the bad one which is five second test fail and one is a great

03:36.790 --> 03:39.410
website that shows their message clearly.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.380
So here is an example of a failed five second test and you can see you ahead.

03:43.380 --> 03:48.690
This is submitted by my student digital con fee from my course to it's designed for beginners too expensive

03:48.690 --> 03:49.930
both concept and models.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.090
Now you can see you here.

03:52.150 --> 03:55.090
We have a form of it here on this page.

03:55.090 --> 04:02.260
We kid one hour of our recruitment Ambassador we contact you shortly and the user is confused about

04:02.320 --> 04:09.100
why and what is happening on this page and why should I give my personal email and name and phone number

04:09.880 --> 04:11.140
to overhear.

04:11.410 --> 04:18.340
So this is but actually my student wrote that I don't don't don't know why should I submit my personal

04:18.340 --> 04:18.600
data.

04:18.610 --> 04:25.780
There is no tag line there is no clear message that why should I use this product or why should I give

04:25.780 --> 04:29.830
my subscribe or give my e-mail address or a.

04:29.830 --> 04:35.770
So this is an example of a failed five second test we do not know what the product is we do not know

04:35.770 --> 04:40.290
what is their message what actually I can do or here.

04:40.300 --> 04:47.870
Now here is an example of a great message or five second test which is going to be this crafted Web

04:47.870 --> 04:48.300
site.

04:48.310 --> 04:54.340
You can see you will hear within few four three seconds I can guess that this is a digital marketing

04:54.340 --> 04:57.670
agency and this is a professional company.

04:57.670 --> 05:05.100
We have all blew over here and in the first five seconds you can always ask me what actually you saw

05:05.110 --> 05:05.530
I.

05:05.620 --> 05:11.780
I would say the product name was crafted or foam name was crafted and they are a digital marketing agency.

05:11.800 --> 05:16.910
So this is a great example of a successful five second test.

05:16.930 --> 05:20.080
This website is going to pass it with great colors.

05:20.590 --> 05:22.490
I will give it five stars.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.070
So this is how actually you do it.

05:24.070 --> 05:34.540
You have to have a clear message a clear tagline a clear memorable product name or service you are offering.

05:34.540 --> 05:38.600
So that is all about five second test if you have any questions to ask me.

05:38.620 --> 05:40.060
Let's move on to the next lesson.
