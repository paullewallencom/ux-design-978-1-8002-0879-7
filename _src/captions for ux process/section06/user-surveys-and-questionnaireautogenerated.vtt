00:04.000 --> 00:09.690
No once you have completed a usability test with your users you are going to get their emotional feeling

00:09.690 --> 00:11.100
about your product.

00:11.100 --> 00:16.380
You are going to get what actually they had overall pass after using their product.

00:16.800 --> 00:23.820
So we are going to use user surveys and we are going to give them to our users after they have completed

00:23.820 --> 00:30.910
usability test and it will have like two to five questions on maybe six or seven no more than 10.

00:30.930 --> 00:38.490
I suggest that it will be easier for the users to give feedback on after using your website or your

00:38.490 --> 00:38.960
app.

00:38.970 --> 00:46.300
Now there are many online tools you can use like Survey Monkey or die form to create these surveys.

00:46.380 --> 00:51.040
All you can give them a printout in their hands and take on that.

00:51.060 --> 00:56.490
So if you are using some online tools you can give them some incentive like we are going to give you

00:56.490 --> 01:01.710
50 percent discount to 10 percent discount on your next book shares or things like that just a little

01:01.710 --> 01:06.980
incentive or incentive or reward for filling out that survey form.

01:06.990 --> 01:10.200
Now you might have filled a lot of different surveys.

01:10.200 --> 01:16.080
I'm going to give you a few surveys that are related to usability test on digital products.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.510
One of them is use questionnaire.

01:18.510 --> 01:23.400
Now this use questionnaire it is going to test for different things useful less ease of use ease of

01:23.400 --> 01:26.060
lending and overall satisfaction if you use it.

01:26.130 --> 01:32.010
So I am also going to show you one example where you can go ahead and see what are the questions you

01:32.010 --> 01:35.540
can add from that section to your app.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.460
According to your needs.

01:37.650 --> 01:45.330
How much easier for your user to learned how much easier for the user to use it how useful it is whether

01:45.330 --> 01:48.100
it meets the need of your users or not.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.880
How much satisfied was your user.

01:50.880 --> 01:56.970
Maybe from one to 10 maybe he was or she was satisfied 50 percent or things like that.

01:57.020 --> 02:02.520
Here is a used questionnaire from Gary.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.180
Gary Pearlman dot com and you can see over here.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.830
Here we have different questions that are related to usefulness.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.480
It helps me to be more effective.

02:12.480 --> 02:16.360
It helps to me to be more productive a productive.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.310
It is useful.

02:17.310 --> 02:20.280
It gives me more control over the activities in my life.

02:20.280 --> 02:27.360
These questions will be different based on a little bit different based on your product so you can see

02:27.390 --> 02:33.840
we have strongly disagree strongly agree on no answer then we have ease of use.

02:33.900 --> 02:34.890
It is easy to use.

02:34.890 --> 02:35.790
It is simple to use.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.520
You can pick bean.

02:37.730 --> 02:42.620
Pick one of them for example I would say it is user friendly.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.840
So maybe it is simple to use this.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.570
This makes more sense to me.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.080
So my users might say like four or things like that.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.510
Then we have ease of learning.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.320
I learned to use it quickly.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.090
It is easy to learn to use it.

02:57.090 --> 03:00.710
I quickly become skillful with their things like that satisfaction.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.160
It is fun to use.

03:02.160 --> 03:08.010
I am satisfied with it and things like that so you can see this is actually a questioning and I am going

03:08.010 --> 03:14.100
to give you the link you can use that and you can have a few more things like net negative aspects of

03:14.100 --> 03:19.680
positive aspects of whatever you have your users have found in your app.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.960
So that is all about a User Questionnaire.

03:21.960 --> 03:26.090
I hope you will use it in your usability test after that.

03:26.310 --> 03:30.030
So let's see what we have more now.

03:30.060 --> 03:35.400
Let's talk about another kind of question here that is going to test the emotional impact of your product

03:35.400 --> 03:36.930
on the on your user.

03:36.930 --> 03:42.480
So it might have questions like whether the product was delightful or not was the product unique or

03:42.480 --> 03:43.530
ordinary.

03:43.530 --> 03:46.980
Was it interesting or boring was it visually attractive.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.680
Was the product clear or confusing.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.170
Was it trustworthy or shady.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.460
Was it simple or complex.

03:53.460 --> 03:59.490
So these are different questions we are going to ask in our attractive questionnaire or survey you might

03:59.490 --> 04:08.190
have seen it in a lot of areas where whenever you talk to any customer satisfaction or sorry customer

04:08.190 --> 04:16.500
support a guy after completing your customer support call you have a surveyor to fill and that is mostly

04:16.500 --> 04:20.190
about the emotional impact that was you.

04:20.200 --> 04:28.310
Are you satisfied with the user or whether you were happy about your interaction with him.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.160
Things like that.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.080
Was your problem solved or not.

04:31.110 --> 04:39.000
So that is basically the overall satisfaction or you see what you use frustrated or not.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.380
Anything you want to say about it now you can see on the right.

04:42.390 --> 04:52.170
We have form from customer thermometer and you can see you here we have one star smiley face frowny

04:52.170 --> 04:56.900
face and a sad face a serious face and a sad sad face.

04:56.900 --> 05:01.710
So this is actually checking the emotional impact from customer support or things like that.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.600
That user actually liked it.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.390
He was happy he was frustrated.

05:05.430 --> 05:10.250
So this is actually you can see emotional testing of your user.

05:10.260 --> 05:16.110
One more thing is whatever questionnaire or surveys you use always gives you is user a space to write

05:16.470 --> 05:17.460
freely.

05:17.550 --> 05:22.530
You can also give them skills like 1 to 10 rating or things like that you are also going to give them

05:22.530 --> 05:28.440
a text area where they can use that and write freely or there.

05:28.440 --> 05:34.300
This will help you if they have something or some suggestion in their mind they might write it over

05:34.310 --> 05:34.680
there.

05:35.220 --> 05:42.690
So I am going to show you a few of the forms or surveys I actually use to improve my courses.

05:42.690 --> 05:46.000
Let me show you which tool I use and how I do it.

05:46.080 --> 05:52.110
Here you can see this is type form and I have one two three four five six seven eight different surveys

05:52.740 --> 05:59.150
and these are ninety five responses for this one so let's open this one and I'm going to show you how

05:59.150 --> 06:03.980
you can make one for free and post it to your users so you can see we're here.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.220
Here is my data limit.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.720
What do you want to next two minute quiz.

06:08.720 --> 06:16.580
I always mention how much long it is because users are going to get boring or maybe they leave it and

06:16.580 --> 06:18.350
then this is the next question.

06:18.350 --> 06:19.640
Type your answer ahead.

06:19.650 --> 06:23.630
Then I have some things to select from here.

06:23.690 --> 06:25.530
Then I have another question.

06:25.730 --> 06:29.800
Then I have the last one which is what are your comments or ideas.

06:29.810 --> 06:33.530
So this is the text field I'm talking about.

06:33.530 --> 06:37.630
So once they have completed it you will get some results over here.

06:38.750 --> 06:43.200
Let me show you now you can see here.

06:43.210 --> 06:44.530
I had all the reserves.

06:44.530 --> 06:49.760
And here we have this question which golf courses you want me to teach you next.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.760
And here are different responses.

06:51.760 --> 06:55.390
And this is how actually makes twenty point nine percent.

06:55.630 --> 06:58.770
And you can use this kind of thing to get this.

06:59.320 --> 07:04.980
Create a questionnaire and get the satisfaction or results from your product or whatever you have.

07:04.990 --> 07:05.890
So this.

07:05.890 --> 07:07.050
These are different commands.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.950
You can see you here.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.690
So this is a great tool type form.

07:11.720 --> 07:18.320
You can also use Survey Monkey and you can also use horchata if you have a current website.

07:18.380 --> 07:23.940
I have used this Hart Hart jar and it is going to give a pop up over here.

07:23.950 --> 07:30.650
It does a lot of things but it actually give feedback out here like you can see over here happy and

07:30.650 --> 07:31.780
things like that.

07:31.790 --> 07:36.860
So this is actually it is going to test the emotional impact and also give the user our tax feel to

07:36.860 --> 07:37.240
fill.

07:37.940 --> 07:38.380
OK.

07:38.750 --> 07:44.750
So this is a great tool if you want to use it properly.

07:44.900 --> 07:53.800
And I would always go for type form I haven't used this survey monkey which is another popular tool.

07:53.810 --> 08:03.410
I know and I have seen a lot of companies that use it so these are different tools to create surveys

08:03.440 --> 08:05.980
and get some feedback from your users.

08:05.990 --> 08:08.840
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.940
Let's move on to the next lesson.
