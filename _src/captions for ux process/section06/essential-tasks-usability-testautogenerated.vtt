WEBVTT

00:04.420 --> 00:07.490
Now let's talk about essential tasks test.

00:07.510 --> 00:14.860
Now this is actually the cream off your usability test because it is actually the main base of usability

00:14.860 --> 00:15.750
tests.

00:15.760 --> 00:21.040
This is the main test you are going to do with your app your website.

00:21.070 --> 00:27.760
And as the name suggests you are going to list out all the different essential tasks your users are

00:27.760 --> 00:34.810
going to perform on your website or your app on daily basis or again and again in my case which is fraudulent

00:34.840 --> 00:42.430
e-commerce for my users are going to mostly do log in sign up check out browsing products filtering

00:42.430 --> 00:48.190
products finding products adding them to the card removing them from the card moving them to the fresh

00:48.190 --> 00:51.530
fish list and moving them back from the visuals to the card.

00:51.640 --> 00:52.870
Things like that.

00:52.870 --> 00:59.620
So I'm going to list out all essential tasks and I'm going to plan out different tasks scenarios and

00:59.620 --> 01:07.930
build them to follow our users to perform and we are going to test all these tasks based on some metric

01:08.110 --> 01:10.330
we're going to see in the next slide.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.120
So let's see what that is.

01:12.130 --> 01:16.330
Now in any usability test there are two ways to do it.

01:16.330 --> 01:23.350
One is that for example I have already a product already of upside which I want to improve and I have

01:23.350 --> 01:29.110
found few problems that I think that this is my problem statement that I believe that users are not

01:29.110 --> 01:30.710
taking an action on this bid.

01:30.730 --> 01:36.700
This is in case of my frock and Web site because the major categories are here and now I'm going to

01:36.700 --> 01:38.790
show the screen after this.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.200
So this will make more sense to you.

01:41.190 --> 01:44.910
Users will navigate easily if we make subcategories to categories.

01:44.920 --> 01:52.120
So we are going to move subcategories and show them visibly on our main categories in our navigation

01:52.120 --> 01:52.930
bar.

01:52.930 --> 01:57.770
This is my eye hypothesis that this is how it will solve this problem.

01:57.790 --> 02:06.130
Now metrics are what are actually the bank marking things we are going to use to test these for example

02:06.130 --> 02:08.410
number of clicks or time to locate the item.

02:08.410 --> 02:14.120
These are the things that are going to decide that I was right or it actually has improved.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.480
Now this is my frock line.

02:15.490 --> 02:21.430
If you remember in the previous lesson we had one main category shop over here and all these categories

02:21.430 --> 02:29.410
party dress is casual they were inside that shop and now my hypothesis is that if I move them outside

02:29.410 --> 02:36.220
like over here and made the major categories rather than subcategories it will help user to locate them

02:36.610 --> 02:41.030
and it will increase our you can say in revenue or clicks.

02:41.110 --> 02:46.660
So we are going to test it with our metric which is time to locate.

02:46.690 --> 02:56.770
This is very essential and I will write some tasks scenario that you want something for your summer

02:56.770 --> 02:57.490
vacations.

02:57.490 --> 03:00.940
What would you where would you go to find that dress.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.630
So if the user goes toward hair Summer and Summer collection that is going to tell me if it takes like

03:07.750 --> 03:11.480
five seconds to them I'm going to make sure that this is great.

03:11.680 --> 03:17.680
We are improving but in the previous design actually we are going to test two versions of this design

03:17.680 --> 03:25.510
one as the previous one which is called A B testing so we are going to test two versions different versions

03:25.870 --> 03:29.850
of the same main page and see which one performs better.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.020
And we will decide that this is actually helping them.

03:33.190 --> 03:36.730
They are able to get to that within two seconds.

03:36.730 --> 03:38.000
This is great.

03:38.080 --> 03:43.090
Now we are going to write our task details in a scenario format a short story.

03:43.090 --> 03:48.810
We are not going to see them that try to click on this go to check out and things like that.

03:48.820 --> 03:54.450
We are not going to give them any hints any labels any navigational items names.

03:54.460 --> 04:02.460
I am I am using for example in case of my website let me show you for example we have summer winter

04:02.520 --> 04:06.150
collection party dresses casual Princess Barbie and things like that.

04:06.150 --> 04:10.080
So I am not going to use a check out or things like that.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.540
I might use that.

04:11.550 --> 04:15.950
What would you do once you have added your items to your card.

04:15.990 --> 04:19.210
How would you go forward from there.

04:19.380 --> 04:20.130
Are things like that.

04:20.130 --> 04:26.400
I'm not going to give them a hint of like try to check out using my website.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.280
This is not a European usability test.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.840
This is a direction you are giving them.

04:30.990 --> 04:33.640
The whole thing you are not going to give them any hints.

04:33.840 --> 04:40.050
Here is an example of writing tasks and for your usability test and case of my frog clan.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.170
Here I am going to give you something like this.

04:43.260 --> 04:49.560
You clicked on a Facebook ad for a kid's clothing website and read this page to buy our dress for your

04:49.560 --> 04:50.500
daughter.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.990
What is the first thing you would do.

04:51.990 --> 04:57.360
I would like to see whether they are going to create a new account or they are going to start adding

04:57.360 --> 04:58.490
dresses to their car.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.850
Things like that.

04:59.850 --> 05:04.050
Now there is another technique that you lead your user from one task to another.

05:04.230 --> 05:09.020
So I start with one task which was previous one I am going to give them a new task.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.270
Now the next task.

05:10.290 --> 05:14.930
Now you want to get a perfect dress for your little girl for her birthday party by tomorrow.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.250
What steps would you take now.

05:16.260 --> 05:18.200
Can you show us things like that.

05:18.270 --> 05:26.160
Then after that once she has added a few dresses to our cart I am going to say what would you do next

05:26.160 --> 05:29.010
to get those dresses at your doorstep.

05:29.010 --> 05:37.050
I am not using keyword checkout so if you see my website right here you can see I have used checkout

05:37.350 --> 05:40.200
over here so I am not using this keyword.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.100
I am not going giving them hints that try to check out from here.

05:45.210 --> 05:51.780
So I would like to see how they actually approach it whether they click this card or here first or whether

05:51.780 --> 05:54.600
they click on this check out things like that.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.190
There are a few things you need to do while you are conducting your usability test.

05:59.190 --> 06:01.830
The first thing is that keep quiet.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.680
Don't give your user.

06:03.900 --> 06:07.920
You can see hints and don't guide them.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.910
Just keep quiet.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.930
This is the most difficult thing I find.

06:10.930 --> 06:16.290
I found out that this is most difficult for me because I talk a lot.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.240
So you have to keep quiet.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.060
You have to not answer their duties.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.010
You just keep them asking what do you expect it to do.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.750
What do you think it does.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.770
You are going to answer the questions with another question.

06:30.780 --> 06:37.170
One more tip is that try to rehearse with your friend or team member before conducting any usability

06:37.170 --> 06:44.890
test because in the first few minutes you are also going to tell them that this is the product.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.160
Introduce them to that.

06:46.170 --> 06:52.200
Tell them a little bit about it and tell them that you are we are going to give you some tasks and we

06:52.200 --> 06:55.260
are not testing you but we are testing this product.

06:55.350 --> 06:57.830
How good it is and how bad it is.

06:57.870 --> 07:00.750
So do whatever you do freely.

07:00.750 --> 07:05.040
Don't try to think that it would be.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.090
We are testing you.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.160
We are just chatting testing this product.

07:08.790 --> 07:13.480
So just to build up some confidence with your user and get familiar with them.

07:13.560 --> 07:19.830
One technique or thing allow technique is you are going to ask your users to keep thinking with their

07:19.830 --> 07:26.280
mouth so they are going to see all the words they are thinking in their head and you are going to record

07:26.280 --> 07:29.100
that video and audio and also write down some notes.

07:29.100 --> 07:33.580
If you find something and this is actually going to help you a lot.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.060
Now let me show you what actually this thing allow.

07:36.060 --> 07:44.520
Technique is now you can see that I am user and I have given a task to go and find some someone collection

07:45.180 --> 07:48.600
or summer clothes or clothes for your heart.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.870
Whether I am also excluding summer or here anyhow.

07:52.350 --> 07:55.060
So I would say something like that.

07:55.150 --> 08:04.440
Okay so I need to dress for a heart whether I would go in some summer collection.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.150
Okay so I have found it.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.470
I'm going to click over here and these are few dresses I can see.

08:11.100 --> 08:14.250
So this is actually I think allowed technique.

08:14.250 --> 08:21.510
Your user is going to say whatever they have in they have been thinking all along while performing these

08:21.510 --> 08:22.410
tasks.

08:22.410 --> 08:28.800
If you use a stop somewhere you have to tell them that I want you to think aloud.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.670
Tell me what are you thinking.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.090
So ask them like that.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.920
Know what we will get from these and usability tests.

08:34.930 --> 08:40.720
We are going to gnaw down all the pain points are all the major frustrations or problems of our users

08:41.170 --> 08:44.020
actually faced and we we're going to lift them out.

08:44.020 --> 08:49.690
We are going to give them suggestions to have our developers and designers that this is how this problem

08:49.690 --> 08:51.100
can be tackled.

08:51.100 --> 08:55.750
This is how this problem can be solved and we are also going to list that.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.430
What is the time taken.

08:57.430 --> 09:02.120
What were the number of atoms whether the user completed successfully or not.

09:02.230 --> 09:03.770
So things like that.

09:03.770 --> 09:10.720
I'm going to show you the template of a form user analysis form you can use while doing these usability

09:10.720 --> 09:11.500
tests.

09:11.590 --> 09:13.130
Make sure you download it.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.250
Now this is a very simple form.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.080
We have a name of a user.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.800
We have prototype number.

09:18.810 --> 09:24.790
Whichever prototype whether it was a check out prototype or whatever we had.

09:24.790 --> 09:30.400
Then the screen name what which screen they were on whether they were on log in screen sign up screen

09:30.820 --> 09:37.190
dos detailed what dos they were performing tasks to complete an address to their card or whatever.

09:37.230 --> 09:41.470
What is the time taken eight minutes rather than complete it or not.

09:41.590 --> 09:44.470
Yes or no completed possible pain points.

09:44.700 --> 09:45.540
No or yes.

09:45.550 --> 09:50.560
And we are going to write some notes over here that this is the pain point they had.

09:50.560 --> 09:57.380
You can also write add another column and give them suggestions that this is how it can be solved.

09:57.400 --> 10:05.030
So this is actually the listing of all your pain points and using different dos and different users.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.860
So I suggest that do it with at least three to five users.

10:08.860 --> 10:16.060
This is the sweet spot and I hope you have enjoyed this lesson and understood what is actually usability

10:16.060 --> 10:18.230
tests and how we perform them.

10:18.340 --> 10:22.180
So let's move on to the next lesson and see what we have ahead.
