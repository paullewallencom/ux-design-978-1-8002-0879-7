00:04.350 --> 00:12.420
Now in the last session we were designing wire frames for our Franklin e-commerce store and now is the

00:12.420 --> 00:15.500
time that we are moving to the development phase.

00:15.810 --> 00:22.500
Now in the design we had prototypes we had wire frames which were the bread and butter and the end result

00:22.500 --> 00:29.610
of our whole user experience design research and whole use of expensive design documentations.

00:29.610 --> 00:37.590
Now in this session we are actually moving to a development phase and there are few things I want to

00:37.860 --> 00:45.150
make sure that you understand that on your development side there will be a lot of decisions based on

00:45.450 --> 00:54.540
speed of response of some system or response time time off any Web site or servers or maybe some limitations

00:54.540 --> 01:01.830
are different frameworks so you are going to as a UI designer or Unix designer you are going to work

01:01.830 --> 01:07.420
closely with the development department or the developers.

01:07.500 --> 01:16.200
So in my case of Franklin we I had two options like going with the WordPress which is along with e-commerce

01:16.200 --> 01:24.000
or commerce which is a plugin and we can also go with Shopify which is another solution for e-commerce

01:24.000 --> 01:24.850
stores.

01:24.930 --> 01:35.160
So Shopify is good for you can send novice users or beginners so I might add you know went towards that.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.250
It is also a bit faster than commerce.

01:38.300 --> 01:45.390
Well Commerce is a plugin so it might be a little bit an option off performance anyhow before going

01:45.390 --> 01:50.270
into full production and you know building a whole Web site.

01:50.400 --> 01:57.330
We are going to build a dummy website dummy means that we will have everything like we had in our VAR

01:57.330 --> 02:04.920
frames but we will have like 15 or 20 or just 30 domain products data.

02:04.920 --> 02:11.990
It is very easy these days a lot of these frameworks these online solutions e-commerce solutions they

02:12.000 --> 02:18.510
let you export or import data and load it the dummy data into your store.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.820
So just request it out.

02:19.810 --> 02:28.110
So on my B.S. I have some development background a bit of development background so I installed a local

02:28.110 --> 02:36.120
server and I am using filled it with some simple data and I am using Wordpress with Ru commerce.

02:36.120 --> 02:43.830
This is a plug in WordPress plus commerce is a plug in solution for e-commerce websites.

02:43.940 --> 02:51.920
So this is actually will save you a lot of time so why I actually did this and your developers might

02:51.920 --> 03:00.230
also do that because before you know going into more details and you know configuring the whole website

03:00.590 --> 03:07.640
or uploading like thousand on maybe five hundred of different actual images of products you need to

03:07.640 --> 03:14.660
test it you need to test run it with few users you need to do some usability tests so that is why we

03:14.660 --> 03:20.960
are going to work with our developers to come up with a solution that is you can see a dummy solution

03:20.960 --> 03:30.350
having some dummy data with just few products just to see how actually we have reached to our level

03:30.350 --> 03:31.920
of user satisfaction.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.610
So that is all I wanted to show you.

03:34.610 --> 03:39.400
I am going to show you know the example where actually I am right now testing.

03:39.530 --> 03:47.240
So let's see that now you can see this looks very empty but we have most of our bits and pieces together

03:47.240 --> 03:53.060
like you can see here we have logo and the tag line then we have the location then we have whatsapp

03:53.060 --> 04:00.920
number then we have email then we have few social social links we don't have right now is a big such

04:00.920 --> 04:06.050
borrower here maybe we want our developers to you know change it a bit.

04:06.290 --> 04:12.600
You can say every time you use this is a free Wordpress theme I'm using this is a free team.

04:12.650 --> 04:16.810
So these are actually the functionalities we have very good card.

04:16.850 --> 04:23.840
Then we have sharp dresses These are the different categories we discussed and we are also going to

04:24.200 --> 04:28.210
make them into two different menus over here.

04:28.220 --> 04:34.290
This will be down and one will be above then we have seals and deals.

04:34.290 --> 04:37.440
Stuff I haven't configured everything.

04:37.590 --> 04:43.500
Then we have featured categories like singles or clothing or whatever 50 percent of still some of the

04:43.510 --> 04:44.340
data is missing.

04:44.340 --> 04:50.190
But this is actually going to work for us to be testing with our users.

04:50.190 --> 04:56.250
You can see there are a few feature products then we have something from our blog and news then we have

04:56.250 --> 04:57.320
the footer.

04:57.450 --> 05:04.680
We have free shipping and then we also need to post this at the top in our header section.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.140
Free shipping in return.

05:06.270 --> 05:11.220
Also money back guarantee and 27 for 7 support something like that.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.840
We already have our phone number.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.980
Everything up there.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.720
This is our address and things like that.

05:16.890 --> 05:20.730
So this will be our starting point for our development.

05:20.730 --> 05:27.180
We are not going to go into full fledged and Web site or developed app.

05:27.180 --> 05:35.670
I have worked previously with a software firm in the UK United Kingdom and there was a guy I used to

05:35.670 --> 05:36.210
work with.

05:36.210 --> 05:45.180
He was a project manager and they choose to develop few mobile games mobile app games and what they

05:45.180 --> 05:46.170
had actually.

05:46.500 --> 05:57.270
Whenever I designed a new wireframe or you can say user experience solution for them they had game engine

05:58.020 --> 06:04.890
ready for prototyping so actually what they did they had like just in this case I had Vu commerce or

06:04.890 --> 06:07.700
e-commerce and I just used the dummy data.

06:07.740 --> 06:18.750
Similarly they had a whole set of dummy game built already built behind the scenes and just the use

06:18.750 --> 06:21.280
that engine and attach it to them.

06:21.330 --> 06:25.680
You can say that interface that is also it was very quick development.

06:25.680 --> 06:34.220
They were using agile UX in their software how so software firm or agency whatever you call them.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.570
I think I still remember that guy.

06:36.570 --> 06:45.240
He was a great project manager and I am just telling you the story that most of the software houses

06:45.270 --> 06:56.760
most of the intelligent and wise developers or coders they have the major engines or major modules already

06:56.760 --> 06:59.070
built and just put together.

06:59.070 --> 07:05.820
Just throw in the interface change bits and pieces over there and it starts working.

07:05.820 --> 07:10.000
This is actually a new era of using modules based.

07:10.350 --> 07:17.420
You can say age value X or angel method of developing something that you use different blocks and use

07:17.460 --> 07:24.450
combine them and create a full product so in this case you are going to work closely with your development

07:24.450 --> 07:32.070
team and you are going to tell them that we need these two things separated and we want to show these

07:33.270 --> 07:39.360
should these categories we don't want them to hide in the dropdown because it will not be visible to

07:39.360 --> 07:40.370
the users.

07:40.500 --> 07:49.530
So we really want to who are our users to actually see them see these categories and select them rather

07:49.530 --> 07:51.420
than you know having a dropdown.

07:51.420 --> 07:57.080
Also we can move this my account and blog and contexts contact us at the top.

07:57.150 --> 08:02.440
Now right now in this course I cannot develop a full fledged Web site right now.

08:02.460 --> 08:10.120
We will use this dummy site to perform for few user testing usability tests in the next few lessons

08:10.120 --> 08:15.690
that I'm going to share the reserves with one or two users because I don't have like five or 10 users

08:15.690 --> 08:21.690
right now so I will do with one or two users you can do it with at least three to five users.

08:21.690 --> 08:28.230
So I hope you have understood my idea that you need to work closely and how you will rapidly develop

08:28.230 --> 08:33.260
your app or website if you have any questions to ask me.

08:33.270 --> 08:35.300
Let's move on to the next lesson.
